  "introduction": {
    "problem_statement": "Fatigue detection using EEG signals faces challenges in handling non-stationary signals, reducing computational complexity via channel optimization, and achieving high accuracy in real-world applications.",
    "proposed_solution": "A novel method combining stationary wavelet transform (SWT) for signal decomposition, Gaussian Copula Mutual Information (GCMI) for connectivity analysis, and SVM for classification. Introduces an automated channel selection algorithm to reduce EEG channels while maintaining performance. Emphasizes real-time feasibility through 9x speed improvement (0.17s/trial).",
    "gap_in_previous_study": "Prior methods relied on techniques like FFT (unsuitable for non-stationary EEG) or DWT/WPT (alter signal length). Existing channel reduction approaches (e.g., spatial CSP-rank, entropy-based selection) lacked efficiency. Limited focus on Gamma/Beta band connectivity for fatigue detection.",
    "issue_being_addressed": "Reducing the Number of EEG Channels",
    "justification": "The paper explicitly introduces a channel selection algorithm to minimize electrodes from 30 to 8 while retaining 97.2% accuracy (±0.57% vs. full channels). This directly addresses computational load and real-time feasibility, as emphasized in Sections 2.5 and 3.15–3.17. The method reduces processing time by 9x (1.5s → 0.17s per trial) and doubles ITR to 41.83 bit/min."

    "exact_reasons_for_selection": {
      "Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT)": "\"SWT does not make any change in signal length, compared to other wavelet transform methods such as DWT and wavelet packet transform (WPT), which is a crucial factor for GCMI calculation.\" 'Haar' mother wavelet with 3 decomposition levels was selected after testing multiple wavelets (db2, sym3, etc.)",
      "Gaussian Copula Mutual Information (GCMI)": "\"GCMI [...] is a highly efficient estimation method due to its ability to transform the marginal distributions of the two variables to a Gaussian copula, which is a standard Gaussian distribution.\"",
      "Support Vector Machine (SVM)": "\"This classifier has been used frequently to classify fatigue and BCI detection systems [...] The kernel function is affected by the two parameters of the penalty factor C and the kernel function G. Optimal selection of the penalty factor C and the kernel function G is important in SVM classification.\" Linear kernel chosen to avoid overfitting risks from complex kernels (RBF/sigmoidal)",
      "Statistical t-test (feature selection)": "\"The extracted features from train data are classified through the statistical t-test based on the p-value.\"",
      "Hyper-parameter optimization": "\"The optimal amount of C and G are calculated with ten times cross-validation in the parameter space.\"",
      "Automated Channel Selection Algorithm": "\"The weight for each electrode based on system accuracy is obtained from the extracted features of that electrode [...] The investigation is done on 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 channels.\"",
      "FORCe Artifact Removal": "\"The fully online and automated artifact removal for brain-computer interfacing (FORCe) method was applied to remove the noise and to make ensure the deactivation of artifacts from signals.\""
    },
    "reasons_for_selection": {
      "Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT)": "SWT was chosen for its time-invariance and ability to preserve signal length, critical for connectivity analysis via GCMI. Unlike DWT/WPT, SWT avoids downsampling, ensuring consistent temporal resolution across decomposition levels. This is vital for non-stationary EEG analysis. Haar wavelet provided optimal accuracy (99.95% in S1) after comparative testing of db/sym families.",
      "Gaussian Copula Mutual Information (GCMI)": "GCMI provides robust connectivity measurement by leveraging Gaussian copulas to handle non-Gaussian marginal distributions. It outperforms traditional MI estimators in small-sample neuroimaging contexts, ensuring reliable feature extraction across wavelet coefficients.",
      "Support Vector Machine (SVM)": "SVM with linear kernel was selected for its proven efficacy in fatigue/BCI classification. Linear kernels avoided overfitting risks from complex kernels (e.g., RBF). Parameters (C, G) were optimized via cross-validation, balancing generalization and misclassification penalties. Achieved 98.15% average accuracy vs. 92% in CNN-based approaches (Zeng et al.).",
      "Statistical t-test (feature selection)": "Used to rank features by statistical significance (p-value) to prioritize discriminative connectivity features between alert/fatigue states. Reduced feature count to <4% of total (4530 → <180 features), minimizing computational load.",
      "Hyper-parameter optimization": "Grid search (C: 2⁻⁸ to 2⁸, G: 2⁻⁶ to 2⁶) with 10-fold cross-validation ensured optimal SVM performance. Repeated 5×5 cross-validation stabilized accuracy estimates.",
      "Automated Channel Selection Algorithm": "Weight-based algorithm assigned importance scores to channels via 5×5 cross-validation. Central/temporal regions (C3, C4, T7) contributed most (55–66% across subjects), aligning with neurophysiological fatigue markers. Achieved 97.2% accuracy with 8 channels vs. 30-channel baseline (97.77%).",
      "FORCe Artifact Removal": "FORCe method was selected for its automated ICA-based artifact removal using wavelet decomposition and thresholding. Removed 3 subjects with excessive artifacts, ensuring clean data for 9 participants."
