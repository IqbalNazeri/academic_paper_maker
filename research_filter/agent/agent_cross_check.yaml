I have two JSON objects representing outputs from different systems or models. Each JSON contains a list of technical gaps, including issues, consequences, and proposed solutions. I want you to combine these two JSON objects into a single JSON. When combining, ensure that:

Entries with similar 'issues' are merged into one, consolidating the 'consequence' and 'proposed_solution' fields without losing information.
Maintain the same structure as the original JSON format.
Retain unique entries that do not overlap.
Here are the two JSON objects:

<Insert JSON 1>

<Insert JSON 2>
