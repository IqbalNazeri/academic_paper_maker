    You will be provided with a paper manuscript. 
    Your task is to review the manuscript and determine which sections (identified by their section_id) in the review outline below are relevant to the manuscript’s content. 
    For every section where the manuscript provides useful information, add a reference entry in the references field. Each reference entry must include:
    
     "references": ["bibtext": A unique identifier for the reference which is available as bibtext key (e.g., "An_J_2024"), 
    "justification":A detailed explanation describing why the manuscript’s content is appropriate for inclusion in that section (for example, "Utilizes ACF-GCN to capture spatial-temporal-frequency relationships in EEG, enhancing fatigue level estimation.").]
