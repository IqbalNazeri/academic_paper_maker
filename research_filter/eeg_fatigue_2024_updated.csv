"M. Alghanim, et al.",2024,A Hybrid Deep Neural Network Approach to Recognize Driving Fatigue Based on EEG Signals,"Electroencephalography (EEG) data serve as a reliable method for fatigue detection due to their intuitive representation of drivers' mental processes. However, existing research on feature generation has overlooked the effective and automated aspects of this process. The challenge of extracting features from unpredictable and complex EEG signals has led to the frequent use of deep learning models for signal classification. Unfortunately, these models often neglect generalizability to novel subjects. To address these concerns, this study proposes the utilization of a modified deep convolutional neural network, specifically the Inception-dilated ResNet architecture. Trained on spectrograms derived from segmented EEG data, the network undergoes analysis in both temporal and spatial-frequency dimensions. The primary focus is on accurately detecting and classifying fatigue. The inherent variability of EEG signals between individuals, coupled with limited samples during fatigue states, presents challenges in fatigue detection through brain signals. Therefore, a detailed structural analysis of fatigue episodes is crucial. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed methodology's ability to distinguish between alertness and sleepiness, achieving average accuracy rates of 98.87% and 82.73% on Figshare and SEED-VIG datasets, respectively, surpassing contemporary methodologies. Additionally, the study examines frequency bands' relative significance to further explore participants' inclinations in states of alertness and fatigue. This research paves the way for deeper exploration into the underlying factors contributing to mental fatigue. © 2024 Mohammed Alghanim et al.       ",Related
"I. Alreshidi, et al.",2024,Advancing Aviation Safety Through Machine Learning and Psychophysiological Data: A Systematic Review,"In the aviation industry, safety remains vital, often compromised by pilot errors attributed to factors such as workload, fatigue, stress, and emotional disturbances. To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly leveraged psychophysiological data and machine learning techniques, offering the potential to enhance safety by understanding pilot behavior. This systematic literature review rigorously follows a widely accepted methodology, scrutinizing 80 peer-reviewed studies out of 3352 studies from five key electronic databases. The paper focuses on behavioral aspects, data types, preprocessing techniques, machine learning models, and performance metrics used in existing studies. It reveals that the majority of research disproportionately concentrates on workload and fatigue, leaving behavioral aspects like emotional responses and attention dynamics less explored. Machine learning models such as tree-based and support vector machines are most commonly employed, but the utilization of advanced techniques like deep learning remains limited. Traditional preprocessing techniques dominate the landscape, urging the need for advanced methods. Data imbalance and its impact on model performance is identified as a critical, under-researched area. The review uncovers significant methodological gaps, including the unexplored influence of preprocessing on model efficacy, lack of diversification in data collection environments, and limited focus on model explainability. The paper concludes by advocating for targeted future research to address these gaps, thereby promoting both methodological innovation and a more comprehensive understanding of pilot behavior. © 2013 IEEE.

"J. A. Bartlett, et al.",2024,Hepatic Encephalopathy in Children,"Hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by mental status changes and neuropsychiatric impairment, is associated with chronic liver disease as well as acute liver failure. In children, its clinical manifestations can be challenging to pinpoint. However, careful assessment for the development of hepatic encephalopathy is imperative when caring for these patients as progression of symptoms can indicate impending cerebral edema and systemic deterioration. Hepatic encephalopathy can present with hyperammonemia, but it is important to note that the degree of hyperammonemia is not indicative of severity of clinical manifestations. Newer forms of assessment are undergoing further research, and include imaging, EEG and neurobiomarkers. Mainstay of treatment currently includes management of underlying cause of liver disease, as well as reduction of hyperammonemia with either enteral medications such as lactulose and rifaximin, or even with extracorporeal liver support modalities. © The Author(s) 2023.

"L. Cao, et al.",2024,Advancing classroom fatigue recognition: A multimodal fusion approach using self-attention mechanism,"This paper presents a novel multimodal tensor fusion network based on the self-attention mechanism (MTFN-SAM) for classroom fatigue recognition. The LSTM network is first employed to learn the fatigue information of different modalities over time. Then, a self-attention mechanism is utilized to capture the connections within the modal features. Finally, a multimodal tensor fusion layer is employed to fuse features from multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate (HR), galvanic skin response (GSR), and acceleration (ACC). The classification accuracy of the experimental results was compared with TFN, LWF, LSTM, and other fusion algorithms, confirming that the proposed MTFN-SAM network had better performance in multimodal feature fusion. Additionally, we found that as the number of modalities increased, the information contained in the multimodal fusion became more abundant, as confirmed by the experimental results (94.11% accuracy after EEG+HR+GSR+ACC fusion). Thus, the method could efficiently identify students’ classroom fatigue. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd       ",Not Related
"W. Chang, et al.",2024,Fatigue Driving State Detection Based on Spatial Characteristics of EEG Signals,"Monitoring the driver’s physical and mental state based on wearable EEG acquisition equipment, especially the detection and early warning of fatigue, is a key issue in the research of the brain–computer interface in human–machine intelligent fusion driving. Comparing and analyzing the waking (alert) state and fatigue state by simulating EEG data during simulated driving, this paper proposes a brain functional network construction method based on a phase locking value (PLV) and phase lag index (PLI), studies the relationship between brain regions, and quantitatively analyzes the network structure. The characteristic parameters of the brain functional network that have significant differences in fatigue status are screened out and constitute feature vectors, which are then combined with machine learning algorithms to complete classification and identification. The experimental results show that this method can effectively distinguish between alertness and fatigue states. The recognition accuracy rates of 52 subjects are all above 70%, with the highest recognition accuracy reaching 89.5%. Brain network topology analysis showed that the connectivity between brain regions was weakened under a fatigue state, especially under the PLV method, and the phase synchronization relationship between delta and theta frequency bands was significantly weakened. The research results provide a reference for understanding the interdependence of brain regions under fatigue conditions and the development of fatigue driving detection systems. © 2024 by the authors.

"J. Chen, et al.",2024,EEG-based emotion recognition for road accidents in a simulated driving environment,"Encountering unexpected events with different levels of danger can cause different levels of emotional changes in the driver, and identifying the driver's mental state can assist in determining whether he or she can control the vehicle. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an essential component of the basis for emotional classification. Current driving-related EEG research has focused chiefly on fatigue driving and road rage. In order to explore the connection between panic emotion and accident-avoidance ability, this paper proposes an EEG acquisition and emotion classification scheme in a simulated driving environment. The scheme uses vehicle speed as a variable to simulate obstacle avoidance at different danger levels. It uses graph neural networks (GNN) with functional connectivity and attention mechanisms to simulate the physiological structure of the brain to process the data. In addition, various experiments were conducted to compare the features from entropy and power perspectives. The three-class classification result reached 75.26%, with a single label's highest F1 score of 76.7%. The binary classification result reached 91.5%, with a single label's highest F1 score of 91.86%. The experimental results show that the solution can effectively simulate different dangerous situations, capture the driver's EEG signals, and effectively monitor the emotional state in combination with deep learning models. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd       ",Not Related
"K. Chen, et al.",2024,EEG spatial inter-channel connectivity analysis: A GCN-based dual stream approach to distinguish mental fatigue status,"Mental fatigue is defined as a decline in the ability and efficiency of mental activities. A lot of research suggests that the transition from alertness to fatigue is accompanied by alterations in correlation patterns among various brain regions. However, conventional methods for detecting mental fatigue seldom emphases inter-channel connectivity in the spatial domain. To fill this gap, this paper explores the spatial inter-channel connectivity in alertness and fatigue, employing spectral graph convolutional networks (GCN) for mental fatigue detection. We utilized Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) to establish temporal connections and magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) for spectral connections. Topological features of the brain network were then analysed. To enhance the learning of spatial inter-channel connectivity, a dual-graph strategy transforms edge features into node features, serving as inputs to the spectral GCN. By simultaneously learning PCC and MSC features, the model results indicate significant differences in some brain network characteristics between alert and fatigue states. It confirms that the synchronicity of brain operations differs in the alert state compared to mental fatigue, and indicates that fatigue states can influence correlation patterns among different brain regions. Our approach is evaluated on a self-designed experimental dataset containing 7 subjects, demonstrating a classification accuracy of 89.59 % in group-level experiments and 95.24 % at the subject level. Additionally, on the public dataset SEED-VIG containing 23 subjects, our method achieves an accuracy of 86.58 %. In summary, this paper proposes a neural network approach based on a dynamic functional connectivity network. The network integrates both temporal and spectral connections with the goal of simultaneously learning spatial inter-channel connectivity in time and frequency domains. This effectively accomplishes fatigue state detection, highlighting that fatigue significantly influences correlations among different brain regions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.       ",Not Related
"Y. Ding, et al.",2024,LGGNet: Learning From Local-Global-Graph Representations for Brain-Computer Interface,"Neuropsychological studies suggest that co-operative activities among different brain functional areas drive high-level cognitive processes. To learn the brain activities within and among different functional areas of the brain, we propose local-global-graph network (LGGNet), a novel neurologically inspired graph neural network (GNN), to learn local-global-graph (LGG) representations of electroencephalography (EEG) for brain-computer interface (BCI). The input layer of LGGNet comprises a series of temporal convolutions with multiscale 1-D convolutional kernels and kernel-level attentive fusion. It captures temporal dynamics of EEG which then serves as input to the proposed local- and global-graph-filtering layers. Using a defined neurophysiologically meaningful set of local and global graphs, LGGNet models the complex relations within and among functional areas of the brain. Under the robust nested cross-validation settings, the proposed method is evaluated on three publicly available datasets for four types of cognitive classification tasks, namely the attention, fatigue, emotion, and preference classification tasks. LGGNet is compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, such as DeepConvNet, EEGNet, R2G-STNN, TSception, regularized graph neural network (RGNN), attention-based multiscale convolutional neural network-dynamical graph convolutional network (AMCNN-DGCN), hierarchical recurrent neural network (HRNN), and GraphNet. The results show that LGGNet outperforms these methods, and the improvements are statistically significant (p< 0.05 ) in most cases. The results show that bringing neuroscience prior knowledge into neural network design yields an improvement of classification performance.

"C. Divvala, et al.",2024,Deep Learning-Based Attention Mechanism for Automatic Drowsiness Detection Using EEG Signal,"An electroencephalograph (EEG) is the basic medical tool to identify disorders related to brain activity. Drowsiness is a natural signal from the body indicating the need for rest and sleep to restore physical and mental well-being. Drowsiness is characterized by lethargy, fatigue, and a strong inclination toward sleep. It is often accompanied by reduced alertness and increased difficulty in maintaining attention and focus on tasks. Individuals experiencing drowsiness may find staying awake challenging and exhibit slower reaction times. This diminished cognitive function can lead to accidents, errors, and decreased performance in various activities. Wearable sensors are utilized in real-time to identify drowsiness detection. However, an automated diagnosis tool is very helpful in identifying drowsiness, and detection is an important task. Therefore, this work proposes a deep learning-based attention mechanism to detect the drowsiness state. This letter uses a publicly available MIT-BIH standard EEG database for experimentation. The proposed model provides a performance accuracy of 98.38% in drowsiness detection. The experiment outcomes demonstrate an enhanced detection capability when compared with current state-of-the-art methods for detecting drowsiness using single-channel EEG signals.       ",Not Related

"X. Fang, et al.",2024,Online Assessment of Spontaneous Mental Fatigue in Construction Workers Considering Data Quality: Improved Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine,"Biological data-based methods for monitoring workers' mental fatigue have become widely adopted in recent years. However, few have concentrated on the online monitoring and assessment of mental fatigue considering the complexity and high dimension of the biological data, especially for scenarios where data arrives continuously in the form of flows. This study aimed to propose an online learning model to learn model parameters according to the order of data acquisition. Specifically, the fuzziness-based online sequential extreme learning machine (Fuzziness-OS-ELM) model was proposed, consisting of two parts: (1) a data value estimator; and (2) an online mental fatigue classification model. As new data arrives, the Fuzziness-OS-ELM model can effectively identify and select samples with high data quality based on fuzziness, which are then used to continuously update the online mental fatigue classification model. A cognitive experiment was carried out to evaluate the Fuzziness-OS-ELM model. The results indicated that samples with low fuzziness corresponded to high data quality. The proposed online sequential learning model exhibited enhanced classification performance on mental fatigue.

"D. Gao, et al.",2024,CSF-GTNet: A Novel Multi-Dimensional Feature Fusion Network Based on Convnext-GeLU- BiLSTM for EEG-Signals-Enabled Fatigue Driving Detection,"Electroencephalography (EEG) signal has been recognized as an effective fatigue detection method, which can intuitively reflect the drivers' mental state. However, the research on multi-dimensional features in existing work could be much better. The instability and complexity of EEG signals will increase the difficulty of extracting data features. More importantly, most current work only treats deep learning models as classifiers. They ignored the features of different subjects learned by the model. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a novel multi-dimensional feature fusion network, CSF-GTNet, based on time and space-frequency domains for fatigue detection. Specifically, it comprises Gaussian Time Domain Network (GTNet) and Pure Convolutional Spatial Frequency Domain Network (CSFNet). The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively distinguishes between alert and fatigue states. The accuracy rates are 85.16% and 81.48% on the self-made and SEED-VIG datasets, respectively, which are higher than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we analyze the contribution of each brain region for fatigue detection through the brain topology map. In addition, we explore the changing trend of each frequency band and the significance between different subjects in the alert state and fatigue state through the heat map.

"D. Gao, et al.",2024,A Comprehensive Adaptive Interpretable Takagi-Sugeuo-Kang Fuzzy Classifier for Fatigue Driving Detection,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, as a reliable biological indicator, have been widely used in fatigue driving detection due to their capacity to reflect a driver&#x0027;s cognitive and neural response state. However, EEG signals have problems such as imbalanced data distribution, significant differences between subjects, and complex scenes, which affect the detection effect. Small commonalities between input objects can be interpreted as important information about an entire sample. Therefore, to retain as much information as possible, We design a new approach for integrating fuzzy features, comprehensive adaptive interpretable TSK fuzzy classifier(CAI-TSK-FC). It not only captures the features of multiple subclassifiers more efficiently and alleviates the dataset imbalance problem. Also, it can reduce the accumulation of error information by randomly retaining fuzzy rules as well as normalization. Finally, we linearly combine the results of multiple subclassifiers to comprehensively consider the learning effect of multiple subclassifiers to adapt to different subjects and datasets. Experiments conducted on both self-made and public datasets (SEED-VIG) show that CAI-TSK-FC has good performance and interpretability on different EEG fatigue driving datasets.

Effective preprocessing and segmentation methods can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ADHD classification. Methods: We applied filtering, ASR, and ICA preprocessing techniques to EEG data from children with ADHD and neurotypical controls.

Classification was performed using various EEG segments and channels with Machine Learning models (SVM, KNN, and XGBoost) to identify the most effective combinations for accurate ADHD diagnosis. Results: Our findings show that models trained on later EEG segments achieved significantly higher accuracy, indicating the potential role of cognitive fatigue in distinguishing ADHD. The highest classification accuracy (86.1%) was achieved using data from the P3, P4, and C3 channels, with key features such as Kurtosis, Katz fractal dimension, and power spectrums in the Delta, Theta, and Alpha bands contributing to the results.

"O. Griffith, et al.",2024,Comorbidity of concussion and depression alters brain functional connectivity in collegiate student-athletes,"Depression and concussion are highly prevalent neuropsychological disorders that often occur simultaneously. However, due to the high degree of symptom overlap between the two events, including but not limited to headache, sleep disturbances, appetite changes, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating, they may be treated in isolation. Thus, clinical awareness of additive symptom load may be missed. This study measures neuropsychological and electroencephalography (EEG) alpha band coherence differences in collegiate student-athletes with history of comorbid depression and concussion, in comparison to those with a single morbidity and healthy controls (HC). 35 collegiate athletes completed neuropsychological screenings and EEG measures. Participants were grouped by concussion and depression history. Differences in alpha band coherence were calculated using two-way ANOVA with post hoc correction for multiple comparisons. Comorbid participants scored significantly worse on neuropsychological screening, BDI-FS, and PCSS than those with a single morbidity and HC. Two-way ANOVA by group revealed significant main effects of alpha band coherence for concussion, depression, and their interaction term. Post-hoc analysis showed that comorbid participants had more abnormal alpha band coherence than single morbidity, when compared to HC. Comorbidity of concussion and depression increased symptom reporting and revealed more altered alpha band coherence than single morbidity, compared to HC. The abnormalities of the comorbid group exclusively showed decreased alpha band coherence in comparison to healthy controls. The comorbidity of depression and SRC has a compounding effect on depression symptoms, post-concussion symptoms, and brain functional connectivity. This research demonstrates a promising objective measure in comorbid individuals, previously only measured via subjective symptom reporting. © 2024       ",Not Related
"T.

To address this issue, this study proposes an approach that combines Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) to develop a low-power model capable of accurately recognizing the driver's mental state.

Gu, et al.",2024,EEG-Based Driver Mental Fatigue Recognition in COVID-19 Scenario Using a Semi-Supervised Multi-View Embedding Learning Model,"With the spread of COVID-19 in recent years, wearing masks has increased the difficulty of driver mental fatigue recognition. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal has become an important physiological signal index to reflect the driver's mental state. However, the drivers' EEG data is plagued by inadequate labels and multi-view data, which makes classification difficult. To solve this problem, this study proposes a semi-supervised multi-view sparse regularization and graph embedding learning (SMSG) model. To obtain discriminative feature representations of semi-supervised EEG data, SMSG fully mines diverse information from multiple views based on sparse regularization embedding and graph embedding technology. SMSG employs the graph embedding to capture the discriminative structure and local manifold structure on multi-view data. Furthermore, SMSG learns the common shared regularization embedding and private regularization embedding factors to preserve the consistency and diversity of the multi-view data. Through self-adaptive learning, the weights of each view can be directly solved adaptively. This works also introduces kernel trick to project the SMSG model into the nonlinear reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which can obtain more approximate EEG feature representation.

"D. Gwon, et al.",2024,Motor task-to-task transfer learning for motor imagery brain-computer interfaces,"Motor imagery (MI) is one of the popular control paradigms in the non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) field. MI-BCI generally requires users to conduct the imagination of movement (e.g., left or right hand) to collect training data for generating a classification model during the calibration phase. However, this calibration phase is generally time-consuming and tedious, as users conduct the imagination of hand movement several times without being given feedback for an extended period. This obstacle makes MI-BCI non user-friendly and hinders its use. On the other hand, motor execution (ME) and motor observation (MO) are relatively easier tasks, yield lower fatigue than MI, and share similar neural mechanisms to MI. However, few studies have integrated these three tasks into BCIs. In this study, we propose a new task-to-task transfer learning approach of 3-motor tasks (ME, MO, and MI) for building a better user-friendly MI-BCI. For this study, 28 subjects participated in 3-motor tasks experiment, and electroencephalography (EEG) was acquired. User opinions regarding the 3-motor tasks were also collected through questionnaire survey. The 3-motor tasks showed a power decrease in the alpha rhythm, known as event-related desynchronization, but with slight differences in the temporal patterns. In the classification analysis, the cross-validated accuracy (within-task) was 67.05 % for ME, 65.93 % for MI, and 73.16 % for MO on average. Consistently with the results, the subjects scored MI (3.16) as the most difficult task compared with MO (1.42) and ME (1.41), with p < 0.05. In the analysis of task-to-task transfer learning, where training and testing are performed using different task datasets, the ME–trained model yielded an accuracy of 65.93 % (MI test), which is statistically similar to the within-task accuracy (p > 0.05). The MO–trained model achieved an accuracy of 60.82 % (MI test). On the other hand, combining two datasets yielded interesting results. ME and 50 % of the MI–trained model (50-shot) classified MI with a 69.21 % accuracy, which outperformed the within-task accuracy (p < 0.05), and MO and 50 % of the MI–trained model showed an accuracy of 66.75 %. Of the low performers with a within-task accuracy of 70 % or less, 90 % (n = 21) of the subjects improved in training with ME, and 76.2 % (n = 16) improved in training with MO on the MI test at 50-shot.

Accurate identification of microsleep is critical for assessing driver alertness and preventing accidents.

The methodology begins with preprocessing raw EEG data to improve quality and balance, utilizing the ADASYN algorithm to address dataset imbalances. After preprocessing, features are extracted using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which provides a comprehensive frequency domain analysis of the EEG signals.

"M. M. Hasan, et al.",2024,Validation and interpretation of a multimodal drowsiness detection system using explainable machine learning,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Drowsiness behind the wheel is a major road safety issue with efforts focused on developing drowsy driving detection systems. However, most drowsy driving detection studies using physiological signals have focused on developing a 'black box' machine learning classifier, with much less focus on 'robustness' and 'explainability'-two crucial properties of a trustworthy machine learning model. Therefore, this study has focused on using multiple validation techniques to evaluate the overall performance of such a system using multiple supervised machine learning-based classifiers and then unbox the black box model using explainable machine learning. METHODS: Driving was simulated via a 30-minute psychomotor vigilance task while the participants reported their level of subjective sleepiness with their physiological signals: electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) being recorded. Six different techniques, comprising subject-dependent and independent techniques were applied for model validation and robustness testing with three supervised machine learning classifiers, namely K-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), and two explainable methods, namely SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis and partial dependency analysis (PDA) were leveraged for model interpretation. RESULTS: The study identified the leave one participant out, a subject-independent validation technique to be most useful, with the best sensitivity of 70.3 %, specificity of 82.2 %, and an accuracy of 80.1 % using the random forest classifier in addressing the autocorrelation issue due to inter-individual differences in physiological signals. Moreover, the explainable results suggest most important physiological features for drowsiness detection, with a clear cut-off in the decision boundary. CONCLUSIONS: The implication of the study will ensure a rigorous validation for robustness testing and an explainable machine learning approach to developing a trustworthy drowsiness detection system and enhancing road safety. The explainable machine learning-based results show promise in real-life deployment of the physiological-signal based in-vehicle trustworthy drowsiness detection system, with higher reliability and explainability, along with a lower system cost.

Additionally, the proposed algorithm exhibits low computational cost, good training stability, and robustness against insufficient training. Therefore, it is promising for further implementation of fatigue online detection systems.

RMSCM effectively extracts highly discriminative long short-Term temporal feature information. Secondly, we propose a dynamic graph convolution module and a spatial graph edges' importance weight assignment method based on brain region partitioning strategy, which can acquire intrinsic spatial feature information between electrodes. Thirdly, we design a feature fusion module (FFM) that utilizes channel attention to fuse long short-Term temporal and spatial features. FFM learns and prioritizes the significance and relevance of each channel in the fused features. Finally, the fused spatio-Temporal features are passed into the classification module to obtain the predicted driver fatigue state. Extensive comparison and ablation studies are conducted on EEG signals collected from real-world driving scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed STFN-BRPS model delivers superior classification performance compared to the mainstream methods.

Hussein, et al.",2024,Developing a method to detect driver drowsiness based on a single EEG channel and discriminated features,"Driver drowsiness is one of the leading causes of road deaths and transportation industry dangers. Due to its direct evaluation of neurophysiological brain activity, electroencephalography (EEG) has been regarded as one of the most reliable physiological indicators for identifying driver drowsiness. This study proposes a straightforward, cost-effective method for detecting driver drowsiness using a single channel. The contribution of this research is the discovery of drowsiness using discriminated features [moments features (M1, M2, M3, M4), roughness features (R1, R2, R3, R4), zero crossing rate (ZCR), sample entropy (SE) and median absolute deviation (MAD)] from publicly available datasets. A novel model was introduced in this study, which involved the fusion of wavelet transform Daubechies order 4 (WTDB4) and residue decomposition (RD) techniques for feature extraction. Various classification algorithms, including the least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) and ensemble models were compared in terms of their performance metrics. The algorithm that exhibited superior accuracy with reduced computational time was chosen to classify the driver's status into two groups: awake and drowsy. Notably, the proposed model achieved an impressive accuracy of 97.95%.       ",Related

Recently, a tactile-based EEG task was introduced to overcome the current limitations of visual-based tasks, such as visual fatigue from sustained attention. However, the classification performance of tactile-based BCIs as control signals is unsatisfactory. Therefore, a novel classification approach is required for this purpose. Here, we propose TSANet, a deep neural network, that uses multibranch convolutional neural networks and a feature-attention mechanism to classify tactile selective attention (TSA) in a tactile-based BCI system. We tested TSANet under three evaluation conditions, namely, within-subject, leave-one-out, and cross-subject. We found that TSANet achieved the highest classification performance compared with conventional deep neural network models under all evaluation conditions. Additionally, we show that TSANet extracts reasonable features for TSA by investigating the weights of spatial filters.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate at the feasibility of detecting alert and drowsy states in drivers using an integration of features from respiratory signals, vehicle lateral position, and reaction time and out-of-vehicle ways of data collection in order to improve the system's performance and applicability in the real world. METHODS: Data was collected from 25 healthy volunteers in a driving simulator-based study. Their respiratory activity was recorded using a wearable belt and their reaction time and vehicle lateral position were measured using tests developed on the driving simulator. To induce drowsiness, a monotonous driving environment was used. Different time domain features have been extracted from respiratory signals and combined with the reaction time and lateral position of the vehicle for modeling. The observer of rating drowsiness (ORD) scale was used to label the driver's actual states. The t-tests and Man-Whitney test was used to select only statistically significant features (p < 0.05), that can differentiate between the alert and drowsy states effectively. Significant features then combined to investigate the improvement in performance using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), the Support Vector Machines (SVMs), the Decision Trees (DTs), and the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) classifiers. The models were implemented in Python library 3.6. RESULTS: The experimental results illustrate that the support vector machine classifier achieved accuracy of 88%, precision of 85%, recall of 83%, and F1 score of 84% using selected features.

In this study, how single and multi-tasking tests affect cognitive workload was examined, and multi-tasking was detected using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In the cognitive workload paradigm, single-task tests with blocks 1 and 2 and multi-tasking tests with block 3 were created. EEG signals obtained from these blocks were treated as different frequency bands and lengths, and binary classification was performed. Two binary classifications were made: block 1–block 3 and block 2–block 3. According to the results, the highest classification accuracy for block 1–block 3 was obtained as 97.11% using the gamma frequency band and 5-s EEG length. For block 2–block 3, the highest classification accuracy was obtained as 90.88% using the gamma frequency band and 5-s EEG length. As a result, this study distinguished multi-tasking and single task with high classification accuracy. The developed model can be used to detect attention deficit and inability to focus.

Generally, the single-modal driving fatigue detection methods have low accuracy and weak anti-interference capability in real environment.

Due to this, creating systems that can monitor drivers and detect early drowsiness has become an important field of research and a challenging task in recent years. Several research attempts were proposed to solve this problem based on several approaches and techniques. The Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most efficient and reliable method, among the physiological signals-based monitoring approaches. In this area, many Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been used to detect EEG-based driver drowsiness. However, due to the limitations of ML techniques, many researchers have shifted their focus to the use of deep learning (DL) techniques, which have demonstrated superior performance in many fields including the physiological signals classification tasks. This paper reviews and discusses numerous new research papers that have proposed and implemented driver drowsiness detection systems based on EEG and deep learning techniques. In addition, we have outlined the limitations and difficulties of the existing works and highlighted and proposed some propositions that will help future field researchers enhance and generalize the results. Based on our thorough analysis, we have determined that the latest advancements in detecting driver drowsiness have employed the convolutional neural network (CNN) technique, which has demonstrated effective performance in classifying signals.

"X. Li, et al.",2024,CWSTR-Net: A Channel-Weighted Spatial–Temporal Residual Network based on nonsmooth nonnegative matrix factorization for fatigue detection using EEG signals,"Mental fatigue is the leading cause of accidents among industrial workers. Deep learning algorithms that harness multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) data have proven to be the most effective means of detecting fatigue in industrial settings. However, the accuracy of current detection methods has not yet reached optimal levels. The inherent complexity and instability of EEG signals present challenges in feature extraction. Moreover, training models directly with all channel information risks capturing irrelevant data, which can lead to overfitting. To tackle these challenges, we have developed the Channel-Weighted Spatial–Temporal Residual Network (CWSTR-Net) for fatigue detection. This network combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) into a deep learning cascade residual network (STR-Net) to extract spatial–temporal features from EEG signals. Furthermore, we have incorporated an unsupervised channel weighting algorithm based on non-smooth nonnegative matrix factorization (nsNMF). The channel weighting is applied before the STR-Net processing. The nsNMF algorithm effectively identifies active brain channels. It derives weights for each lead by analyzing signals with complex internal correlations through matrix decomposition, thus providing crucial insights for decoding brain signals. Our network achieved an average accuracy of 97.23% on the SEED_VIG dataset, outperforming previous EEG fatigue detection models.

"X. Li, et al.",2024,Enhanced performance of EEG-based brain–computer interfaces by joint sample and feature importance assessment,"Electroencephalograph (EEG) has been a reliable data source for building brain–computer interface (BCI) systems; however, it is not reasonable to use the feature vector extracted from multiple EEG channels and frequency bands to perform recognition directly due to the two deficiencies. One is that EEG data is weak and non-stationary, which easily causes different EEG samples to have different quality. The other is that different feature dimensions corresponding to different brain regions and frequency bands have different correlations to a certain mental task, which is not sufficiently investigated. To this end, a Joint Sample and Feature importance Assessment (JSFA) model was proposed to simultaneously explore the different impacts of EEG samples and features in mental state recognition, in which the former is based on the self-paced learning technique while the latter is completed by the feature self-weighting technique. The efficacy of JSFA is extensively evaluated on two EEG data sets, i.e., SEED-IV and SEED-VIG. One is a classification task for emotion recognition and the other is a regression task for driving fatigue detection.

"Z. Li, et al.",2024,EEG-based detection of adverse mental state under multi-dimensional unsafe psychology for construction workers at height,"Working at height in construction sites is universal but dangerous, which can directly or indirectly lead to numerous injuries and fatalities. Meanwhile, workers' adverse mental state exerts a significant influence on the occurrence of safety accidents. Recent attempts have been made to precisely detect workers' unsafe psychology using electroencephalogram (EEG) technology. Unfortunately, unidimensional psychological factors considered in previous studies cannot represent complicated mental state. To fill this major knowledge gap, this study proposed a framework for comprehensively considering the effects of multi-dimensional critical unsafe psychology (i.e., fear of height, distraction, and mental fatigue) on workers’ adverse mental state at height. Results show that the four support vector machines (SVMs) achieved excellent performance with 96.33%, 96.75%, 95.50%, and 96.50% accuracy, respectively, when inputting the critical EEG features for adverse mental state assessment, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In addition, the Gaussian kernel SVM achieved 96.50% accuracy and balanced classification performance, making it most applicable to the development of adverse mental state assessment approach. The framework proposed reveals the complex interactions between unsafe psychology and adverse mental states, enriching the theoretical models of occupational safety and mental health. It provides a more comprehensive perspective on the factors influencing unsafe environments at high altitudes. This offers the possibility for the automatic detection of adverse mental states, contributing to a more proactive approach to safety management in high-altitude operations. © 2024       ",Not Related
"S. Liang, et al.",2024,Adaptive Multimodel Knowledge Transfer Matrix Machine for EEG Classification,"The emerging matrix learning methods have achieved promising performances in electroencephalogram (EEG) classification by exploiting the structural information between the columns or rows of feature matrices. Due to the intersubject variability of EEG data, these methods generally need to collect a large amount of labeled individual EEG data, which would cause fatigue and inconvenience to the subjects. Insufficient subject-specific EEG data will weaken the generalization capability of the matrix learning methods in neural pattern decoding. To overcome this dilemma, we propose an adaptive multimodel knowledge transfer matrix machine (AMK-TMM), which can selectively leverage model knowledge from multiple source subjects and capture the structural information of the corresponding EEG feature matrices. Specifically, by incorporating least-squares (LS) loss with spectral elastic net regularization, we first present an LS support matrix machine (LS-SMM) to model the EEG feature matrices. To boost the generalization capability of LS-SMM in scenarios with limited EEG data, we then propose a multimodel adaption method, which can adaptively choose multiple correlated source model knowledge with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy on the available target training data. We extensively evaluate our method on three independent EEG datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves promising performances on EEG classification. © 2012 IEEE.

However, how mental fatigue modulates IIV remains unclear. Consequently, the development of robust mental fatigue detection methods at the single-trial level is challenging. New methods: Based on a long-duration flanker task EEG dataset, the modulations of mental fatigue on IIV were explored in terms of response time (RT) and trial-to-trial latency variations of event-related potentials (ERPs). Specifically, latency variations were quantified using residue iteration decomposition (RIDE) to reconstruct latency-corrected ERPs. We compared reconstructed ERPs with raw ERPs by means of temporal principal component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, a single-trial classification pipeline was developed to detect the changes of mental fatigue levels. Results: We found an increased IIV in the RT metric in the fatigue state compared to the alert state. The same sequence of ERPs (N1, P2, N2, P3a, P3b, and slow wave, or SW) was separated from both raw and reconstructed ERPs using PCA, whereas differences between raw and reconstructed ERPs in explained variances for separated ERPs were found owing to IIV. Particularly, a stronger N2 was detected in the fatigue than alert state after RIDE. The single-trial fatigue detection pipeline yielded an acceptable accuracy of 73.3%. Comparison with existing methods: The IIV has been linked to aging and brain disorders, and as an extension, our finding demonstrates IIV as an efficient indicator of mental fatigue.

However, constructing suitable multi-objective problem models alongside effective search strategies stands out as a critical factor that impacts the performance of multi-objective channel selection algorithms. This paper presents a two-stage sparse multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (TS-MOEA) to address channel selection problems in brain-computer interface systems. Methods: In TS-MOEA, a two-stage framework, which consists of the early and late stages, is adopted to prevent the algorithm from stagnating. Furthermore, The two stages concentrate on different multi-objective problem models, thereby balancing convergence and population diversity in TS-MOEA. Inspired by the sparsity of the correlation matrix of channels, a sparse initialization operator, which uses a domain-knowledge-based score assignment strategy for decision variables, is introduced to generate the initial population. Moreover, a Score-based mutation operator is utilized to enhance the search efficiency of TS-MOEA. Results: The performance of TS-MOEA and five other state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms has been evaluated using a 62-channel EEG-based brain-computer interface system for fatigue detection tasks, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of TS-MOEA. Conclusion: The proposed two-stage framework can help TS-MOEA escape stagnation and facilitate a balance between diversity and convergence. Integrating the sparsity of the correlation matrix of channels and the problem-domain knowledge can effectively reduce the computational complexity of TS-MOEA while enhancing its optimization efficiency.

Extensive research has demonstrated the efficacy of utilizing Electroencephalogram (EEG) for accurate fatigue detection. However, the laborious and cost-intensive process of EEG labeling, compounded by the issue of label reliability, poses a substantial challenge. Most of the current studies are based on multi-channel EEG signals, which are not conducive to the application of intelligent vehicle systems because they require abundant complex wiring. Based on the EEG signals of the left forehead, this paper proposes a self-training semi-supervised method to transform unlabeled data into pseudo-labeled data and combines the fuzzy entropy feature after scale-transformation of the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) to establish a driving fatigue recognition model. In this work, three kinds of features of EEG in the time domain, frequency domain, and entropy were extracted to train the semi-supervised model of self-training. Unlabeled data is predicted using this model, and high-confidence pseudo-labeled data is amalgamated with the labeled data. The multi-scale fuzzy entropy algorithm based on CEEMDAN was used to establish the classification model. The results show that the CEEMDAN fuzzy entropy method can improve the recognition accuracy by about 8 %, and the use of pseudo-labeled data with high confidence obtained by single self-training for model training can improve the recognition accuracy. Compared with other recognition methods based on single-channel forehead EEG, this method has higher accuracy.

However, EEG signals have strong variability and significant individual differences, which put forward extremely high requirements on the generalization ability of the model in practical use. To address these issues, a dynamic threshold distribution domain adaptation network (DTDDAN) is proposed to classify the EEG signals for driver fatigue recognition. In the model, the domain discriminator is introduced to alleviate the marginal distribution difference of different domains, and a new loss, Jensen–Shannon loss (JS loss), is applied to relieve the conditional distribution difference of different domains to learn cross-subject invariant deep features of EEG signals. In addition, we propose a dynamic threshold pseudo label strategy to assign pseudo labels to the samples of the target domain in the training process of the model. This strategy can make sure that the high-quality unlabeled data of the target domain contribute to the model training and the model can fully learn the information of the target domain.

Kinesthetic Motor Imagery (KMI) represents a robust brain paradigm intended for electroencephalography (EEG)-based commands in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, ensuring high accuracy in multi-command execution remains challenging, with data from C3 and C4 electrodes reaching up to 92% accuracy. This paper aims to characterize and classify EEG-based KMI of multilevel muscle contraction without relying on primary motor cortex signals. Approach. A new method based on Hurst exponents is introduced to characterize EEG signals of multilevel KMI of muscle contraction from electrodes placed on the premotor, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal cortices. EEG signals were recorded during a hand-grip task at four levels of muscle contraction (0%, 10%, 40%, and 70% of the maximal isometric voluntary contraction). The task was executed under two conditions: first, physically, to train subjects in achieving muscle contraction at each level, followed by mental imagery under the KMI paradigm for each contraction level. EMG signals were recorded in both conditions to correlate muscle contraction execution, whether correct or null accurately. Independent component analysis (ICA) maps EEG signals from the sensor to the source space for preprocessing. For characterization, three algorithms based on Hurst exponents were used: the original (HO), using partitions (HRS), and applying semivariogram (HV). Finally, seven classifiers were used: Bayes network (BN), naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), random tree (RT), multilayer perceptron (MP), and k-nearest neighbors (kNN).

So accurate fatigue detection in drivers plays a crucial role in reducing the number of people fatalities or injured resulting from accidents. Several methods are proposed for fatigue driver recognition among which electroencephalography (EEG) is one. This paper proposed a method for fatigue recognition by EEG signals with extracted features from source and sensor spaces. The proposed method starts with preprocessing by applying filtering and artifact rejection. Then source localization methods are applied to EEG signals for active source extraction. A multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model is fitted to selected sources, and a dual Kalman filter is applied to estimate the source activity and their relationships. Then multivariate autoregressive moving average (ARMA) is fitted between EEG and source activity signals. Features are extracted from model parameters, source relationship matrix, and wavelet transform of EEG and source activity signals. The novelty of this approach is the use of ARMA model between source activities (as input) and EEG signals (as output) and feature extraction from source relations. Relevant features are selected using a combination of RelifF and neighborhood component analysis (NCA) methods. Three classifiers, namely k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and naive Bayesian (NB) classifiers, are employed to classify drivers. To improve performance, the final label for fatigue detection is calculated by combining these classifiers using the voting method.

For this purpose, 25 OSA patients participated in 3-minute eyes closed resting state EEG session on the following morning of overnight PSG recording. Time, spectral domain, and nonlinear features were extracted from the delta, theta, and alpha subbands’ of EEG signals. Several machine learning algorithms were used to classify patients’ severity. To investigate optimal feature combinations features were grouped according to their types (Time domain/spectral domain and nonlinear), their electrodes (frontal/central/parietal/occipital), and their subbands (delta/theta/alpha). Also, the Relief method was applied to select the most relevant features. A 5-fold cross validation method was used to generalize the model behaviour. Optimal feature combinations were selected according to classifiers' performances that were evaluated by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) parameters when feature sets were used as input.

Main results. Results indicate that classification on clusters achieves higher accuracy than scenarios without clustering, suggesting successful grouping of subjects with similar FC characteristics through clustering, thereby enhancing the classification process.

The main advantage of Hjorth parameters compared to other EEG features is its ability to provide rich information about the complexity and mobility of the EEG signal in a relatively simple and fast way. Based on the results of activity feature extraction, feature values will tend to increase during the post-SAR operation conditions compared to the pre-operation SAR conditions. In addition, the results of the classification of pre- and post-operative SAR conditions using Bagged Tree algorithm (10-fold cross validation) show that the highest accuracy can be obtained is 94.8%. © 2024 Department of Agribusiness, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.

Panwar, et al.",2024,EEG-CogNet: A deep learning framework for cognitive state assessment using EEG brain connectivity,"The assessment of cognitive states such as workload, attention, and fatigue is crucial in cognitive science and human performance fields due to its significant impact on work efficiency and decision-making. This paper introduces a deep learning framework for cognitive state assessment using Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain connectivity. The framework was evaluated using EEG data from 26 participants through three computer-based tasks: the Dual N-Back Task, Visual Search Task, and Continuous Performance Task, each designed to induce varying levels of cognitive workload, attention, and fatigue, respectively. A comprehensive dataset was meticulously compiled, including physiological, behavioral, and subjective data to ensure robust analyses. The EEG data underwent rigorous pre-processing and feature extraction processes, focusing on brain connectivity metrics such as Coherence and Phase-Locking Value across multiple frequency bands and employing three neural network architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks (ConvLSTM) for classification. The proposed work achieved classification accuracies of 96.53% for workload, 98.40% for attention, and 97.86% for fatigue in the combined frequency bands. The study's findings underscore the potential of EEG-based methods for non-invasive cognitive state monitoring. By addressing existing limitations such as small sample sizes and task-specific models, this research enhances the generalizability and applicability of EEG-based cognitive assessments.

Reddy, et al.",2024,An Effective Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Single-Channel EEG-Based Subject-Independent Drowsiness Recognition,"Nowadays, road accidents pose a severe risk in cases of sleep disorders. We proposed a novel hybrid deep-learning model for detecting drowsiness to address this issue. The proposed model combines the strengths of discrete wavelet long short-term memory (DWLSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) models to classify single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Baseline models such as support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), back propagation neural networks (BPNN), CNN, and CNN merged with LSTM (CNN+LSTM) did not fully utilize the time sequence information. Our proposed model incorporates a majority voting between LSTM layers integrated with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the CNN model fed with spectrograms as images. The features extracted from sub-bands generated by DWT can provide more informative & discriminating than using the raw EEG signal. Similarly, spectrogram images fed to CNN learn the specific patterns and features with different levels of drowsiness. Furthermore, the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and conventional baseline methods, achieving an average accuracy of 74.62%, 77.76% (using rounding, F1-score maximization approach respectively for generating labels) on 11 subjects for leave-one-out subject method. It achieved high accuracy while maintaining relatively shorter training and testing times, making it more desirable for quicker drowsiness detection. The performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) are evaluated after 100 randomized tests along with a 95% confidence interval for classification.

This study comprises two main parts. First, we propose a visual-stimulus pattern with sequential numbers to exhibit the responses and observe the electroencephalogram (EEG) features of visual flicker imagination in offline testing.

Previous research has primarily concentrated on utilizing data from sober states to establish DF models while rarely considering driving fatigue, a common and risky driving state. This study proposes a scheme to analyze the effects of fatigue on DF identification and emphasizes the necessity of incorporating fatigue in DF models. Firstly, we conducted simulated driving experiments to collect the drivers’ behavior data, facial videos, and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Secondly, we calculated DF indicators using a double-layer sliding time window and used the Kruskal-Wallis test to extract the DF features. Finally, we divided the full sample set into three subsets: a sober sample subset, a fatigue sample subset, and a double state sample subset containing both sober and fatigue data. We used each sample subset to train DF models based on principal component analysis and long short-term memory. We then utilized all three sample subsets to evaluate the DF models trained by each subset. Combined with the correlation between the indicators and KSS, we analyzed the influence of fatigue on DF identification. The results indicated that the identification accuracies of DF models built solely on sober data significantly decreased when applied to fatigue data. The average accuracy of the 7-driver groups showed the most substantial reduction of 54.59%. Conversely, DF models considering fatigue demonstrated a notable increase in the identification accuracy of drivers, and the maximum increase of 25.47% was from the 7-driver groups. Additionally, we discussed the effects of time windows and the number of drivers on DF identification accuracy and an application framework for driver identification systems based on DF integrating driving fatigue detection.

However, EEG signals have poor user adaptability and low classification accuracy in practical applications, and sEMG signals are susceptible to abnormalities such as muscle fatigue and weakness, resulting in reduced stability. To improve the accuracy and stability of interactive training recognition systems, we propose a novel approach called the Attention Mechanism-based Multi-Scale Parallel Convolutional Network (AM-PCNet) for recognizing and decoding fused EEG and sEMG signals. Firstly, we design an experimental scheme for the synchronous collection of EEG and sEMG signals and propose an ERP-WTC analysis method for channel screening of EEG signals. Then, the AM-PCNet network is designed to extract the time-domain, frequency-domain, and mixed-domain information of the EEG and sEMG fusion spectrogram images, and the attention mechanism is introduced to extract more fine-grained multi-scale feature information of the EEG and sEMG signals. Experiments on datasets obtained in the laboratory have shown that the average accuracy of EEG and sEMG fusion decoding is 96.62%.

"A. Turki, et al.",2024,A sophisticated Drowsiness Detection System via Deep Transfer Learning for real time scenarios,"Driver drowsiness is one of the leading causes of road accidents resulting in serious physical injuries, fatalities, and substantial economic losses. A sophisticated Driver Drowsiness Detection (DDD) system can alert the driver in case of abnormal behavior and avoid catastrophes. Several studies have already addressed driver drowsiness through behavioral measures and facial features. In this paper, we propose a hybrid real-time DDD system based on the Eyes Closure Ratio and Mouth Opening Ratio using simple camera and deep learning techniques. This system seeks to model the driver's behavior in order to alert him/her in case of drowsiness states to avoid potential accidents. The main contribution of the proposed approach is to build a reliable system able to avoid false detected drowsiness situations and to alert only the real ones. To this end, our research procedure is divided into two processes. The offline process performs a classification module using pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect the drowsiness of the driver. In the online process, we calculate the percentage of the eyes' closure and yawning frequency of the driver online from real-time video using the Chebyshev distance instead of the classic Euclidean distance. The accurate drowsiness state of the driver is evaluated with the aid of the pretrained CNNs based on an ensemble learning paradigm. In order to improve models' performances, we applied data augmentation techniques for the generated dataset. The accuracies achieved are 97 % for the VGG16 model, 96% for VGG19 model and 98% for ResNet50 model.

"F. Wang, et al.",2024,Study on a Novel Flow-Controllable Semi-Dry Electrode for EEG Signal Acquisition,"Traditional electrodes often face a series of problems when collecting electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The lack of conductive medium between the dry electrode and the skin results in high contact impedance, which degrades the quality of the collected signal. When the wet electrode is used, the conductive gel evaporates quickly, and the operation is complex. A conventional semi-dry electrode's conductive fluid flow is ineffectively controlled, wasting conductive fluid in the process. To solve these concerns, this paper proposes a novel semi-dry electrode, which has a smaller contact impedance than the conventional dry electrode and is more portable than the wet electrode. The unique valve structure of the electrode allows the flow of conductive fluid to be controlled, which makes the electrode less conductive liquid than the conventional semi-dry electrode. In addition, the tip structure of the electrode is designed to pass through thick hair more effectively, ensuring that the conductive fluid is in full contact with the skin. This semi-dry electrode uses a bipolar electrode setup to collect EEG signals from construction equipment operators. The results show that the novel electrode has a strong correlation with the EEG signal features collected by the traditional wet electrode.

However, the large impedance of the dry electrode often results in poor signal acquisition quality. Meanwhile, the preparation of wet electrodes in experiments is complex, and replenishing the conductive gel is not convenient. Therefore, based on the comprehensive consideration of the trade-off between wet and dry electrodes used for data acquisition, a novel valve-type semidry electrode is proposed. The semidry electrode has the advantages of convenient wearing and convenient replenishment of conductive liquid. In addition, this experiment is conducted in a real building construction environment, and the acquired EEG signals are highly susceptible to being mixed with various noises. In this study, a deep residual shrinkage networks (DRSNs) algorithm with strong antinoise ability is used to construct a recognition model of construction equipment operators' mental fatigue using EEG-based features. The DRSN algorithm removes mixed noise and redundant features to improve the recognition accuracy of mental fatigue. These results show that the novel valve-type semidry electrode can collect EEG signals with fatigue characteristics just as well as the wet electrode. The ability to maintain small impedances for a long time can benefit long-period EEG signal acquisition. Additionally, the DRSN algorithm was used to classify the mental fatigue state of 12 subjects.

Current fatigue detection efforts have primarily targeted the mental fatigue of agricultural machinery operators and the physical fatigue associated with the manual handling of items and harvesting. In beekeeping, beekeepers not only inspect the honeycombs inside beehives for honey collection but also frequently handle the beehives themselves to observe the lower layers or to transport them to different locations, resulting in both mental and physical fatigue, which can lead to property loss and threaten their personal safety. To address this, a comprehensive fatigue detection model for beekeepers is developed in the present study, using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and deep learning to assess the combined effect of physical and mental fatigue. EEG signals were recorded from participants under two transportation conditions (manual handling and with an auxiliary device). The participants also provided a self-assessment of their fatigue levels according to a five-category scale (no, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme fatigue). The EEG signals were preprocessed, including artifact removal and data cropping, and then a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) method was used to generate time–frequency images from the signals. Data augmentation techniques such as random masking and Gaussian noise were also applied. A deep learning model employing a three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) with three convolutional layers was then constructed and its performance compared to existing 3D-ResNet-18 and 3D-DenseNet-121 models. A convolutional block attention module (CBAM) was incorporated into these models to capture important spatial and channel weights from the feature images during training (3D-CNN(CBAM), 3D-ResNet-18(CBAM), 3D-DenseNet-121(CBAM)). A mask layer was also applied to the feature images after adding the CBAM to manually adjust the spatial weights and focus the models on mid- to high-frequency signals for fatigue classification (MASK-3DCNN(CBAM), MASK-3D-ResNet-18(CBAM), MASK-3D-DenseNet-121(CBAM)). Following training and validation, the model with the highest fatigue prediction accuracy was found to be MASK-3DCNN(CBAM), with an average accuracy of 94.9 % and a detection accuracy higher than 93.3 % for each of the five fatigue levels. Given that the inference time for the individual validation data across all models did not exceed 0.01 s, MASK-3DCNN(CBAM) was selected as the optimal model for its simple structure and balanced detection capability across different fatigue levels.

"P. Zhao, et al.",2024,Multiscale Global Prompt Transformer for EEG-Based Driver Fatigue Recognition,"Driver fatigue is a critical factor that lead to traffic accidents with a high fatality rate. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most reliable indicators to objectively assess fatigue status, but recognizing fatigue driving status from it is still an essential and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a multiscale global prompt Transformer (MsGPT) deep learning model, which can automatically recognize driver fatigue end-to-end. First, we construct an intra-inter-scale cascade framework based on Transformer with a multiscale convolutional patch embedding (MC-PatchEmbed), and guide global-local feature interaction by adding a global prompt token throughout. Second, to efficiently integrate intra-scale and inter-scale feature information, we design a mixed token by aggregating the output from the intra-scale, which includes rich low-level feature information for multiscale. Moreover, a novel learnable query is introduced into multi-head self-attention (MSA) to reduce the computational complexity to linear level. Experiments are conducted on the SEED-VIG dataset and the SADT dataset with both intra-subject and inter-subject settings to evaluate the performance of MsGPT, and the results show that MsGPT greatly outperforms various methods in terms of the classification evaluation metrics of EEG-based fatigue driving. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This paper considers the use of raw EEG data to recognize the driver fatigue state. Existing methods mainly rely on manually extracted EEG features and convolutional neural network (CNN) based inference. However, the large intra-individual and inter-individual differences greatly limit the extraction of EEG fatigue features. This paper suggests a multiscale global prompt Transformer (MsGPT) deep learning model. This model leverages a shared weighting mechanism to construct an inter-to intra-scale multiscale framework that can capture refined fatigue features not achievable at a single scale, we incorporate a new Transformer of the global prompt mechanism, which facilitates multiscale local-to-global fusion of long-term physiological signals. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method on two datasets with intra-subject and inter-subject settings. The proposed method can be readily deployed in the automatic driving assistance system to alert drivers to avoid or reduce traffic accidents caused by excessive fatigue. IEEE       ",Related
"Z. Zhuang, et al.",2024,A Connectivity-Aware Graph Neural Network for Real-Time Drowsiness Classification,"Drowsy driving is one of the primary causes of driving fatalities. Electroencephalography (EEG), a method for detecting drowsiness directly from brain activity, has been widely used for detecting driver drowsiness in real-time. Recent studies have revealed the great potential of using brain connectivity graphs constructed based on EEG data for drowsy state predictions. However, traditional brain connectivity networks are irrelevant to the downstream prediction tasks. This article proposes a connectivity-aware graph neural network (CAGNN) using a self-attention mechanism that can generate task-relevant connectivity networks via end-to-end training. Our method achieved an accuracy of 72.6% and outperformed other convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph generation methods based on a drowsy driving dataset. In addition, we introduced a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to capture important features and demonstrated that the SE attention score can reveal the most important feature band. We compared our generated connectivity graphs in the drowsy and alert states and found drowsiness connectivity patterns, including significantly reduced occipital connectivity and interregional connectivity. Additionally, we performed a post hoc interpretability analysis and found that our method could identify drowsiness features such as alpha spindles.

"S. J. Zong, et al.",2024,Application and Challenges of EEG Signals in Fatigue Driving Detection,"People frequently struggle to juggle their work, family, and social life in today’s fast-paced environment, which can leave them exhausted and worn out. The development of technologies for detecting fatigue while driving is an important field of research since driving when fatigued poses concerns to road safety. In order to throw light on the most recent advancements in this field of research, this paper provides an extensive review of fatigue driving detection approaches based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. The process of fatigue driving detection based on EEG signals encompasses signal acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Each step plays a crucial role in accurately identifying driver fatigue. In this review, we delve into the signal acquisition techniques, including the use of portable EEG devices worn on the scalp that capture brain signals in real-time. Preprocessing techniques, such as artifact removal, filtering, and segmentation, are explored to ensure that the extracted EEG signals are of high quality and suitable for subsequent analysis. A crucial stage in the fatigue driving detection process is feature extraction, which entails taking pertinent data out of the EEG signals and using it to distinguish between tired and non-fatigued states. We give a thorough rundown of several feature extraction techniques, such as topology features, frequency-domain analysis, and time-domain analysis. Techniques for frequency-domain analysis, such wavelet transform and power spectral density, allow the identification of particular frequency bands linked to weariness. Temporal patterns in the EEG signals are captured by time-domain features such autoregressive modeling and statistical moments. Furthermore, topological characteristics like brain area connection and synchronization provide light on how the brain’s functional network alters with weariness. Furthermore, the review includes an analysis of different classifiers used in fatigue driving detection, such as support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and Bayesian classifier. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each classifier, along with their applications in EEG-based fatigue driving detection. Evaluation metrics and performance assessment are crucial aspects of any detection system. We discuss the commonly used evaluation criteria, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Comparative analyses of existing models are conducted, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, we emphasize the need for a standardized data marking protocol and an increased number of test subjects to enhance the robustness and generalizability of fatigue driving detection models. The review also discusses the challenges and potential solutions in EEG-based fatigue driving detection. These challenges include variability in EEG signals across individuals, environmental factors, and the influence of different driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose solutions such as personalized models, multimodal data fusion, and real-time implementation strategies. In conclusion, this comprehensive review provides an extensive overview of the current state of fatigue driving detection based on EEG signals. It covers various aspects, including signal acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, performance evaluation, and challenges.

"Y. Ouyang, et al.",2025,DAEEGViT: A domain adaptive vision transformer framework for EEG cognitive state identification,"Cognitive state identification based on Electroencephalography (EEG) not only helps to diagnose various types of cognitive dysfunctions as early as possible in the clinical field, but also enables timely detection of cognitive overload caused by subjects’ participation in cognitive tasks, which could prevent many accidents from occurring. Deep learning (DL) plays a vital role in the recognition of cognitive states based on EEG. However, due to the significant individual differences of EEG, it remains a great challenge to design a robust deep learning model to identify the cognition state in time and effectively. In this study, a domain adaptive vision transformer framework DAEEGViT is proposed for cognitive state identification. In DAEEGViT, a MBConv module with a self-attention mechanism is introduced to extract the global and local features of EEG simultaneously, followed by a domain adaptation method to improve the transfer learning capability and a classifier to predict the cognitive state. Two self-collected datasets: FDD and ECED, with two public datasets: SEED and SEED-IV have been used in our experiments to identify the fatigue, cognitive impairment and emotion states. Compared with the normal ViT model, in the intra-subject experiments, the accuracy of DAEEGViT improved 25.28%, 54.70% and 43.70% on FDD, SEED, and SEED-IV, respectively. In the cross-subject experiments, it improved 1.23%, 1.85%, and 0.97% on three tasks of ECED (Happiness, neutral and sadness). On FDD, SEED, and SEED-IV, it improved 14.33%, 4.72% and 5.35%, respectively. The results prove that DAEEGViT has distinguished improvement in cognitive state recognition. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd       ",Not Related
"X. Tang, et al.",2025,Riding feeling recognition based on multi-head self-attention LSTM for driverless automobile,"With the emergence of driverless technology, passenger ride comfort has become an issue of concern. In recent years, driving fatigue detection and braking sensation evaluation based on EEG signals have received more attention, and analyzing ride comfort using EEG signals is also a more intuitive method. However, it is still a challenge to find an effective method or model to evaluate passenger comfort. In this paper, we propose a long- and short-term memory network model based on a multiple self-attention mechanism for passenger comfort detection. By applying the multiple attention mechanism to the feature extraction process, more efficient classification results are obtained. The results show that the long- and short-term memory network using the multi-head self-attention mechanism is efficient in decision making along with higher classification accuracy. In conclusion, the classifier based on the multi-head attention mechanism proposed in this paper has excellent performance in EEG classification of different emotional states, and has a broad development prospect in brain-computer interaction. © 2024       ",Not Related
