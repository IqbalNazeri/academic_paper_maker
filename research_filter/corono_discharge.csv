"K. F. Al-Raheem, et al.",2008,Application of the Laplace-Wavelet combined With ANN for rolling bearing fault diagnosis,,A new technique for automated detection and diagnosis of rolling bearing conditions is proposed. The time-domain vibration signals of rolling bearing with different fault conditions are processed using Laplace wavelet transform for features extraction. The extracted features in time and frequency domain of the wavelet transform coefficients are applied as input vectors to artificial neural networks (ANN) for rolling bearing fault classification. The Laplace-Wavelet shape and the ANN classifier parameters are optimized using a genetic algorithm. To speed up the computation and increase the accuracy of classification process the predominate wavelet transform scales are used for features extraction. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique for bearing conditions identification with very high success rate using minimum input features. © 2008 COMADEM International.       
"A. Arulrajah, et al.",2003,Factors affecting field settlement assessment and back-analysis by the Asaoka and hyperbolic methods,,"Thick deposits of marine clay are commonly present in coastal regions of the tropics. Land reclamation on this marine clay formation will require some form of ground treatment works to accelerate the consolidation process. The aim of ground treatment works is to negate settlements under the fill load, future dead and live loads. The use of prefabricated vertical drains with a preloading option is the most widely used ground improvement method for the improvement of marine clays in land reclamation projects. After taking into account the submergence effect and settlement of the reclaimed land surcharge of the equivalent working load is placed until the required degree of consolidation of the marine clay is obtained. As such, the assessment of the degree of consolidation of the marine clay is of paramount importance prior to the removal of the preload. The most suitable means of carrying out this assessment is by means of field settlement monitoring. During the process of consolidation, the field settlement monitoring data can be analysed by means of the Asaoka and hyperbolic methods to predict the ultimate settlement and the degree of consolidation of the underlying soft marine clay. There are various factors that affect the predictions by these methods such as the period of assessment after surcharge placement and the time interval used for the assessment. The aim of the paper is to highlight the significance and impact of these factors on the field settlement assessment and the back-analysis of the coefficient of consolidation due to horizontal flow of soft clays and with special regard to coastal marine clays.

"P. Baraldi, et al.",2011,Identification of contradictory patterns in experimental datasets for the development of models for electrical cables diagnostics,,"The state of health of an electrical cable may be difficult to know, without destructive or very expensive tests. To overcome this, partial discharge (PD) measurements have been proposed as a relatively economic and simple-to-apply experimental technique for retrieving information on the state of health of an electrical cable. The retrieval is based on a relationship between PD measurements and the health of the cable. Given the difficulties in capturing such relationship by analytical models, empirical modeling techniques based on experimental data have been propounded. In this view, a set of PD measurements have been collected by Enea Ricerca sul Sistema Elettrico-ERSE during past campaigns, for building a diagnostic system of electrical cable health state. These experimental data may contain contradictory information which remarkably reduces the performance of the state classifier, if not a priori identified and possibly corrected. In the present paper, a novel technique based on the Adaboost algorithm is proposed for identifying contradictory PD patterns within an a priori analysis aimed at improving the diagnostic performance. Adaboost is a bootstrap-inspired, ensemble-based algorithm which has been effectively used for addressing classification problems. © RAMS Consultants.       "

"J. Haiying, et al.",2012,Simulation of cross-shaped ultrasonic array applied to partial discharge location in oil,,A study on a combined sensor was made for partial discharge(PD) location in oil. The sensor includes a cross-shaped ultrasonic phased array of 13 elements and an ultra-high frequency (UHF) electromagnetic conformal array of 4 elements. The ultrasonic array can achieve the array performance of 61 elements with high-order cumulant processing technology.

Various faults could occur in a transformer such as overload current, overheating, partial discharge and arcing, which can judge various fault-related conditions. According to the conventional way of the dissolved gas analysis, the fault is probably determined. As researcher knows, the IEC codes cannot determine the fault in many cases.

EEG signals have the advantages of universality, spontaneity, and difficulty in deception, making them capable of accurately reflecting genuine emotional states. In this field, researchers have conducted binary (high/low) and ternary (low/medium/high) classification studies on the valence and arousal levels in the DEAP dataset.However, in order to better identify deep and intrinsic emotions, a clear definition of emotions becomes particularly important. Therefore, this study refers to Russell's Circumplex Model, which arranges emotions in a circular manner based on their valence and arousal levels. The study proposes placing emotion labels from the DEAP dataset within the two-dimensional emotional space of the circumplex model. Emotions are defined as four labels - Excited, Afraid, Sad, and Relaxed - based on a linear distribution of valence and arousal levels.Furthermore, a hybrid deep learning model combining CNN and Transformer is proposed for multi-scale spatial-temporal feature extraction. This model is employed for the classification of the four emotions.

The authors have demonstrated its capability towards failure prediction on XLPE cables. In this study, five sets of fifty number of identical XLPE cables were taken up for the investigation. These tests were carried out on both damaged and undamaged conditions. The data acquired during their loading cycles is analyzed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which is further developed to predict the failure performance of power cable. Using this approach one could appreciate that impending failure is significant even at 50 to 60 % of maximum expected operating voltage (MEOV) with a reasonable error margin. In fact, till date there is no lucid method spelt out in the open literature for the failure prediction of XLPE Cables. Moreover, this methodology can also be applied to predict in real time the failure of similar XLPE cables made of material systems. Also, in order to verify the results, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) is used for data analysis.

All the input features are reordered through the support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) method, and the optimal feature subset is selected, with cross-validation and grid search introduced to improve SVM adaptive and classification accuracy. The results indicate the validity on majority types of defects recognition except for a little mistake on viod in spacer. In addition, we also find that the SVM classifier input with only nine optimum features can obtain a better diagnosis performance than choosing all the calculated features as the input vectors. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

"P. T. Tsarabaris, et al.",2006,A classification of the leakage current pulses of high voltage contaminated porcelain insulators using a self-organized neural network,,"This paper proposes a classification system for leakage current values on high voltage porcelain insulators, and presents the results, which derived. The proposed system can be divided into two parts: the first part consists of a high sampling rate and high precision measuring system and the second part consists of a self-organized neural network, which is responsible for the classification of the leakage current patterns. The analysis of the results showed that current values, which are measured, could be divided into three categories. The first category consists of low amplitude (less than 3.62 mA) leakage current values, which are located in a rather linear region of the leakage current waveform. Current values of the second and third category have medium (from 3.62 mA to 10.21 mA) and high (greater than 10.21 mA) amplitudes respectively, and belong to a strictly non-linear area of the waveform. Those values constitute short and long width pulses and are attributed to the presence of partial discharges and arcs on the insulator surface. The results of this work are being analyzed and physical interpretations on the above classification are attempted. The system can probably be helpful in the further investigation of the phenomena observed on contaminated industrial insulators as well as an alarm device for heavily polluted insulators, which are in service. © 2006 CRL Publishing Ltd.

Second, we evaluated several preprocessing strategies on the corpus, and assessed their effects on Uyghur language sentiment classification.

The experimental results indicated the following: first, all the preprocessing techniques showed clear advantages, and most of all, the co mbined features created from unigrams and Part-ofSpeech-based phrases (PBPs) performed better than other features. Second, SVM achieved better accuracy for the unigrams and combined features of unigrams with PBPs, while BNB had better accuracy for the bigrams and combined features of unigrams with bigrams.

"K. Wang, et al.",2013,Nonnegative matrix factorization aided principal component analysis for high-resolution partial discharge image compression in transformers,,"In this study, the development of nonnegative matrix factorization aided principal component analysis (NMF-PCA) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem that the covariance matrix cannot be computed due to the extremely high vector space caused by the ""matrix-to-vector"" transformation when principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to high-resolution image compression, which is further employed for PD gray image compression and recognition. In the proposed NMF-PCA algorithm, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is firstly employed to decompose the high-resolution image into base matrices W and coefficient matrices H with lower dimension. Then, PCA is adopted to extract several principal components from the vectors of W and H as features. A fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method is responsible for PD classification and features evaluation. Using a traditional pulse current detector for PD experiment, 177 gray images associated with four PD defect types are obtained for NMF-PCA testing. The results of algorithm performance evaluation show that NMF and PCA both have fast responding time when r is less 3, which is suitable for PD on-line analysis and diagnosis. The recognition results of experimental PD samples demonstrate that only is the feature set FH extracted from the coefficient matrix H fit for PCA compression of PD gray images. Meanwhile, the maximum successful clustering rate 0.9661 is achieved by 3D features of FH with r = 2, which is much higher than 0.8023 of traditional PRPD operators. In addition, the FCM validity measures report that the features obtained by NMF-PCA have better aggregation characteristic than PRPD statistical operators. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed NMF-PCA algorithm could provide an effective tool for PD diagnosis, and it is easy to extend to other image or matrix applications. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

After that, DAG-SVM based classifier are used to predict the classes of PQ disturbances. The NSGA III algorithm generates optimalsolutions based on multi objective optimization and then fitness function is generated with the help of Pareto front to obtain unique features set from power signals. The NSGA III not only optimizes selected features with DTCWT but also reduces the computational time in comparison with the traditional NSGA II.

Mann, et al.",2021,Online monitoring of gas transfer rates during CO and CO/H2 gas fermentation in quasi-continuously ventilated shake flasks,10.1002/bit.27722,"Syngas fermentation is a potential player for future emission reduction. The first demonstration and commercial plants have been successfully established. However, due to its novelty, development of syngas fermentation processes is still in its infancy, and the need to systematically unravel and understand further phenomena, such as substrate toxicity as well as gas transfer and uptake rates, still persists. This study describes a new online monitoring device based on the respiration activity monitoring system for cultivation of syngas fermenting microorganisms with gaseous substrates. The new device is designed to online monitor the carbon dioxide transfer rate (CO2TR) and the gross gas transfer rate during cultivation. Online measured data are used for the calculation of the carbon monoxide transfer rate (COTR) and hydrogen transfer rate (H2TR). In cultivation on pure CO and CO + H2, CO was continuously limiting, whereas hydrogen, when present, was sufficiently available. The maximum COTR measured was approximately 5 mmol/L/h for pure CO cultivation, and approximately 6 mmol/L/h for cultivation with additional H2 in the gas supply. Additionally, calculation of the ratio of evolved carbon dioxide to consumed monoxide, similar to the respiratory quotient for aerobic fermentation, allows the prediction of whether acetate or ethanol is predominantly produced. Clostridium ljungdahlii, a model acetogen for syngas fermentation, was cultivated using only CO, and CO in combination with H2. Online monitoring of the mentioned parameters revealed a metabolic shift in fermentation with sole CO, depending on COTR. The device presented herein allows fast process development, because crucial parameters for scale-up can be measured online in small-scale gas fermentation. © 2021 The Authors.

Particular attention was directed toward different process strategies regarding the use of nutrient-rich feed media and temperature shifts. These intentionally performed process manipulations broadened the variances in the obtained fluorescence spectra and this was suspected to hamper the generation of reliable soft sensors. Principal component analysis of the obtained fluorescence data showed that temperature shift and feeding strategy had a considerable impact on the fluorescence signals. Partial least square regression models were calculated for the prediction of glucose, lactate, monoclonal antibody (mAb), and viable cell concentrations (VCC). It was aimed to integrate all 2DFS datasets in the respective calibration models regardless of the process-strategy-dependent diversity. Contrary to the expectations, it was feasible to calibrate soft sensors for the online prediction of glucose (7 latent variables (LVs), R2cal = 0.97, rout mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) = 1.1 g L−1), lactate (5 LV; R2cal = 0.96; RMSEP = 0.5 g L−1) and mAb concentrations (4 LV; R2cal = 0.99; RMSEP = 11.4 mg L−1). Feeding and temperature shifts had the highest impact on the VCC model (3 LV; R2cal = 0.94; RMSEP 3.8 × 105 mL−1), nevertheless the prediction of VCC from the fed-batch 2DFS data was feasible. The results strongly indicate that variances in the datasets due to the process strategy can be tolerated to some extent by the respective soft sensors. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

"M. J. Mühlmann, et al.",2018,Prediction of recombinant protein production by Escherichia coli derived online from indicators of metabolic burden,10.1002/btpr.2704,"Background: The oxygen transfer rate (OTR) and the biomass concentration are two important parameters describing a microbial fermentation. It has been shown before that from the course of these parameters over time information on metabolic burden during heterologous protein production can be obtained. While online monitoring in large fermenters is ubiquitously established, it is still not a common practice in small-scale cultures. Nevertheless, several techniques like the Respiration Activity MOnitoring System (RAMOS) device for online monitoring of the OTR in shake flasks and the BioLector device for measuring scattered light (ScL) representing biomass in microtiter plates have been developed. Results: A new microtiter plate-based method is presented that reveals how online derived ScL signals can be transformed into signals that are proportional to the courses of OTR over time for Escherichia coli. The transformed signal is obtained by simply taking the first derivative of ScL (dScL/dt). The proportionality of both parameters is successfully validated for the strains E. coli BL21(DE3) and Tuner(DE3) expressing cellulases and the fluorescent protein FbFP, respectively. Relative amounts of produced heterologous proteins are predicted exclusively based on the course of the transformed ScL signal. A variety of induction conditions with varying inducer concentration and induction time were investigated with this method. Conclusion: The presented method based on ScL measurement allows for high-throughput online determination of signals proportional to OTR courses.

"J.

Wavelet transform has been widely adopted for the extraction of PD signals. However, its performance is highly dependent on proper selection of mother wavelet, decomposition levels and thresholding method. Such selection involves a series of complicated and extensive computations. Moreover, it is also difficult to find a mother wavelet, which has a high degree of similarity to PD signals generated by different types of PD sources. This paper proposes a novel differential signal extraction method as an alternative to wavelet transform for PD signal extraction. Its implementation is straight-forward as it does not involve any mother wavelet selection and decomposition level determination. It can effectively extract PD signals in the presence of multiple PD sources.

We used baselines images of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to calculate average gray-matter density and average relative cerebral metabolic rate for glucose in each region. Later, we classified AD, MCI and cognitively normal (CN) subjects using the individual features extracted from each atlas template and the combined features of both atlases. We reduced the dimensionality of individual and combined features using principal component analysis, and used support vector machines for classification. We also ranked features mostly involved in classification to determine the importance of brain regions for accurately classifying the subjects. Results demonstrated that features calculated from multiple atlases lead to improved performance compared to those extracted from one atlas only. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.       "

In this article, machine learning-based lung tumor detection, classification and segmentation algorithm is proposed. The tumor classification phase first smooth the source lung computed tomography image using adaptive median filter and then discrete time complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) is applied on this smoothed lung image to decompose the entire image into a number of sub-bands. Along with the decomposed sub-bands, DWT, pattern, and co-occurrence features are computed and classified using co-active adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (CANFIS). The tumor segmentation phase uses morphological functions on this classified abnormal lung image to locate the tumor regions. The multi-evaluation parameters are used to evaluate the proposed method.

The main limitation of transcranial US image-based diagnostics is a high degree of subjectivity caused by low quality of the transcranial images. The article presents a developed image analysis system and evaluates the potential of automated image analysis on transcranial US. Methods—The system consists of algorithms for the segmentation and assessment of informative brain regions (midbrain and substantia nigra) and a decision support subsystem, which is equipped with 64 classification algorithms. Transcranial US images of 191 participants (118 patients with a clinical PD diagnosis and 73 healthy control participants) were analyzed. Results—The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity achieved by the proposed system were 85% and 75%, respectively. Conclusions—Digital transcranial US image analysis is challenging, and the application of a such system as the sole instrument for decisions in clinical practice remains inconclusive. However, the proposed system could be used as a supplementary tool for automated assessment of US parameters for decision support in PD diagnostics and to reduce observer variability. © 2017 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

The samples were characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis as a simple method to predict the piezoelectric properties of the cellular PP obtained. The results were then related to morphological analysis based on scanning electron microscopy and mechanical properties in tension. The results showed that the presence of a nucleating agent (CaCO3) substantially improved the morphology (in terms of cell size and cell density) of the produced foam. Also, an optimization of the extrusion (screw design, temperature profile, blowing agent, and nucleating agent content) and post-extrusion (calendering temperature and speed) conditions led to the development of a stretched eye-like cellular structure with uniform cell size distribution. This morphology produced higher storage and loss moduli in the machine (longitudinal) direction than for the transverse direction, as well as higher piezoelectric properties. The morphological and mechanical results showed that higher cell aspect ratio led to lower Young's modulus, which is suitable to achieve higher piezoelectric properties. Finally, the best quasi-static piezoelectric d33 coefficient was 550 pC/N for a cellular PP ferroelectret having a uniform eye-like cellular structure using N2 as the ionizing gas inside the cells, while the highest value was only 250 pC/N when air was used. Hence, the value of d33 can be improved by more than 100% just by replacing air with N2 as the ionizing gas. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.       "

"Y. Yang, et al.",2018,Effect of pulse width on streamer propagation of underwater corona discharge,10.1002/ppap.201800028,"The propagation of pulsed negative corona discharges in water as a function of electrical pulse width ranging from 100 ns to 100 μs has been studied experimentally. Using point-to-plane electrodes, it is demonstrated that the propagation of streamers exhibits different behavior under excitations with different pulse width. For pulses with width shorter than 1 µs, the average velocity stays relatively constant at about 1000 m s−1. For pulses with width longer than 1 µs, the average velocity decreases dramatically with increasing pulse width. Numerical fitting shows that the relationship between the velocity and pulse width follows u ∝ τ−0.72. Two different mechanisms are proposed to explain the different discharge characteristics observed at different time scales. At the initial stage before the generation of any significant heat, we show that the electrostatic force may play a major role in supplying the driving force. As the pulse width increases, the gas temperature rises, and the pressure caused by evaporation may become the dominant force to push the head of the filament to propagate. The transition time between two modes was estimated to be in the order of microseconds. Our quantitative predictions are in reasonable agreement with experimental results. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim       "

Therefore, it is important to identify PDs from different PD sources under noisy condition in insulations, with the highest accuracy. Although many studies on classifying different PD types in insulation have been performed, some signal processing methods have not been used in the past for this application. Thus, in this work, Cepstrum analysis on PD signals combined with artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to classify the PD types from different PD sources simultaneously under noisy condition. Measurement data from different sources of artificial PD signals were recorded from insulation materials. Feature extractions were performed on the recorded signals, including Cepstrum analysis, discrete wavelet transform, discrete Fourier transform, and wavelet packet transform for comparison between the different methods. The features extracted were used to train the ANN. To investigate the classification accuracy under noisy signals, the remaining data were corrupted with artificial noise.

The methods are aimed at classifying patterns derived from the measured characteristics of the electrical signals typically resulting from insulation defects. In this paper, variants of the counterpropagation neural network architecture are used to classify patterns representing various properties of partial discharges. It is shown that the classification quality can be improved considerably when an extended counterpropagation network with a dynamically changing network topology, and an additional vigilance unit for monitoring the behaviour of the network during the learning phase is applied. The extended network has significant advantages over the standard counterpropagation network in cases where outliers in the training data seriously degrade the approximation quality of the standard network. When using the proposed network in conjunction with physically motivated discharge data, input patterns from defect categories not considered during training can be rejected more reliably. This rejection problem is particularly important for practical applications where misclassifications cannot be tolerated.       "

The best combination of features was selected from 14 features extracted from force signals by using a Sequential Forward Search algorithm. Back-propagation neural networks (BPNs) used two features for online classification. When the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was applied, seven features were needed for the classification. For online measurements, only one feature is needed for BPN. Three features are needed for ANFIS for online measurements. For online classification of turning tool conditions, a 2 × 20 × 1 BPN can achieve a success rate of higher than 86% while a 7 × 2 ANFIS can reach a success rate of higher than 96%. For online measurements of tool wear, the estimation error can be as low as 1.37% when a 1 × 20 × 1 BPN was used while the error can be as low as 0.56% using a 3 × 3 ANFIS. Therefore, the 3 × 3 ANFIS can be used first to predict the degradation of tool conditions during the turning process. It can also be used to measure the tool wear online so as to take feedback control action to enhance accuracy of the process. Once the detected tool wear is close to the worn-out threshold, the 7 × 2 ANFIS will be then applied to classify the tool conditions in order to stop the turning operation on time automatically so as to assure the quality of products and to avoid catastrophic failure. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

One strategy is to feed these conditions into a predictive modeling kernel which would in turn give the properties of the finished part. In the case of roughness, the surface resulting from turning can be largely represented as the trace of the passing tool geometry. The question addressed herein is whether computationally intensive modeling of the surface accounting for tool nose radius is necessary for online monitoring of surface roughness. This paper presents a predictive modeling methodology wherein the tool-workpiece contact position varies under a simple cutting model, and the resulting surface roughness is estimated. It presents the concept of calculating a ""pseudo-roughness"" value based only on tool tip locations and to compare this value to that determined by full predictive modeling of the tool geometry. Cutting experimental data has been presented and compared to predictions for model validation. It is found that the root mean square roughness calculation is dominated by tool geometry, rather than tool position deviations and surface roughness estimation could be implemented without a computationally intensive modeling component, thereby enabling online monitoring and potentially real-time control of the part finish. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

The results show that there is a linear relationship between the thermal deformation and the temperature rise at the point of golden section.

This limits its ability as a viable manufacturing process particularly in the aerospace and medical industries where high quality and repeatability are critical. A variety of defects, which may be initiated during powder bed fusion additive manufacturing, compromise the repeatability, precision, and resulting mechanical properties of the final part. One approach that has been more recently proposed to try to control the process by detecting, avoiding, and/or eliminating defects is online monitoring. In order to support the design and implementation of effective monitoring and control strategies, this paper identifies, analyzes, and classifies the common defects and their contributing parameters reported in the literature, and defines the relationship between the two. Next, both defects and contributing parameters are categorized under an umbrella of manufacturing features for monitoring and control purposes. The quintuple set of manufacturing features presented here is meant to be employed for online monitoring and control in order to ultimately achieve a defect-free part. This categorization is established based on three criteria: (1) covering all the defects generated during the process, (2) including the essential contributing parameters for the majority of defects, and (3) the defects need to be detectable by existing monitoring approaches as well as controllable through standard process parameters.

During high-speed milling processes, cutting tools wear fast, leading to increased cutting forces and vibrations and decreased surface quality with increased power consumption. To investigate the effect of cutting forces and vibrations on high-speed milling processes, models for determining cutting forces and vibrations are presented in this paper. Stochastic tool wear was obtained from a probabilistic approach based on the combination of cutting force and systematic single-point vibration analyses. The singularity obtained from the vibration sensor signal is determined by the holder exponent (HE) through the wavelet transform maximum module. In addition, the nonlinear processes caused by the deformation and geometry of the cutting blade, the basis of selecting HE as an indicator to estimate the singularity points of the vibration signal, are also considered. To provide a model for predicting and optimising cutting forces, tool wear, vibrations, surface quality and power consumption, a new hybrid algorithm, i.e. back-propagation neural network and multi-objective particle swarm optimisation, was developed to determine the optimal cutting parameters to minimise the total power consumption, improve surface quality and increase tool life. High-speed milling experiments were conducted to confirm the accuracy and availability of the proposed multi-objective prediction and optimisation model. The improved optimisation method based on the proposed model can increase the surface quality and tool life by 5.95% and 9.87%, respectively.

Quick and accurate online recognition of current hob wear state is crucial to curb this type of machining error during the continuous gear hobbing process. For most of CNC machine tools, an in-depth analysis of the spindle power consumption signal is the common way to monitor the tool wear condition. However, the variation of the spindle current signal is not only related to tool wear state but also the thermal-induced error and the different machining allowances of workpieces to be cut. Therefore, it is barely possible to find one or two individual signal features to precisely characterize the change of hob wear state. In this study, to find the features with strong characterization abilities, we proposed a new tool wear experiment strategy to collect the power consumption data and the thermal-induced error in the entire thermal deformation developing period as well as the representative value of different machining allowances of workpieces. Based on collected spindle power consumption data, we indiscriminately extracted both the time-domain and the frequency-domain features and formed a high-dimensional 47*100 feature dataset. Subsequently, some extracted features were excluded by conducting a correlation analysis with the help of collected thermal error data and machining allowance data, and the rest was further compressed to nine new synthetic features with a dimension-reduced treatment by using the deep autoencoder algorithm. Finally, a mapping model between the synthetic features and different hob wear states was developed by adopting the back propagation neural network classification algorithm. To prove the practicability of this mapping model, another gear cutting experiment was conducted and the results showed the accuracy of this hob wear state online monitoring approach can reached to over 90%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

Due to sampling noise and the slight differences between different types of discharge pulses in reciprocating traveling WEDM, it is easy to misjudge discharge pulse types based solely on the gap voltage and current in the conventional discharge state monitoring system. To provide more accurate feedback signals and achieve better machining performance, this study proposes to monitor gap discharge states using radio frequency signals. Radio frequency signals are analyzed in both the frequency and time domains. After determining the range of radio frequency signals through frequency domain analysis, radio frequency signals in a specific frequency range are amplified after filtering out noise and undesired signals. In addition, for sampling convenience, the radio frequency signal is processed using an envelope detection circuit for frequency down-conversion. In the time domain analysis, the available radio frequency signal is obtained and analyzed for different types of discharge pulses. Based on an ISO-pulse power supply, the characteristic analog radio frequency signal is used to classify the discharge pulses. The radio frequency signal monitoring system is then used to provide feedback signals for the servo feed rate control system. The experimental results indicate a substantial improvement in the classification accuracy. The material removal rate is improved by about 10% in roughing, and the surface quality is improved slightly. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

The highest temperature occurs at the contact surface between the tool and the chip, which is difficult for non-contact measuring methods such as the infrared thermal imaging technique. For other measuring methods, such as thermocouples, an additional small hole is required to be drilled before the sensor is able to be placed at the designated position, which greatly increases the cost. This paper presented a cutting temperature measurement with an ink-jet printed thermistor array. The printed sensor had high thermal index β, which possessed high temperature sensitivity, while its miniature dimension contributed to a fast response time. The ink-jet printing sensors can be made in advance so the setup time is short. Also, the sensors can be easily installed at different locations on the tool or the workpiece. In order to estimate the tool tip temperature, the finite element method (FEM) was used with the measured temperatures as inputs, which was known as an inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP). In order to increase computation efficiency to meet the requirement of online monitoring, the model order reduction method (MOR) was applied. In both non-cutting and cutting experiments, the temperature history could be easily estimated. In this study, the tool tip temperature was updated in 0.72 s, while the errors were only about 10% in non-cutting tests. This made it possible for online monitoring of cutting temperatures, while complex tool geometry and boundary conditions were considered. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

Lee, et al.",2023,Online monitoring and prediction for surface roughness in rotational electro-magnetic finishing using acoustic emission and vision-based neural network,10.1007/s00170-023-12654-w,"The importance of surface finishing processes and accurate surface quality prediction models has increased in response to the growing demand for improved surface finish in ultra-precision applications. To enhance process efficiency and develop accurate predictive models, numerous studies have investigated the monitoring and prediction of surface roughness. However, existing mathematical approaches encounter challenges in establishing the correlation between input and output variables and providing real-time surface status monitoring. Therefore, this study aimed to monitor and predict surface roughness in real-time for the rotational electro-magnetic finishing (REMF) process using acoustic emission (AE) signals. First, a total of 72 fundamental experiments were conducted based on the mixed orthogonal array L18(21 × 34) to determine the optimal configuration for achieving a high-quality surface. The results revealed that the best combination was achieved with an abrasive length of 3.0 mm, an abrasive diameter of 0.7 mm, a total abrasive weight of 2.0 kg, a rotational speed of 1800 rpm, and a working time of 10 min. To analyze signal features and develop an accurate surface prediction model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was suggested, utilizing scalogram images as time–frequency characteristics of AE signals. The suggested model demonstrated outstanding quantitative results compared to those of the regression model, with training coefficient of determination (R 2), mean squared error (MSE), and F-test of 0.986, 0.19 × 10−3, and 99%, and testing R 2, MSE, and F-test of 0.951, 2.23 × 10−3, and 99%, respectively. In addition, the suggested model showed good generalization ability with a relatively lower mean MSE of 0.003 through verification experiments. These results demonstrated that the sensory data and image-driven model were effective in real-time monitoring and surface roughness prediction in the REMF process with high accuracy and reliability. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

"N. A. Al-geelani, et al.",2018,Identification of acoustic signals of corona discharges under different contamination levels using wavelet transform,10.1007/s00202-017-0568-5,"Partial discharges (PDs) emit energy in several ways, producing electromagnetic emissions in the form of radio waves, light and heat, and acoustic emissions in the audible and ultra-sonic ranges. These emissions enable us to detect, locate, measure, and analyse PD activity in order to identify faults before the development of failures, because once present, the damage caused by PDs always increases, leading to asset losses, outages, protection-system failure, disaster, and huge energy losses. Therefore, it is of great importance to identify different types of PDs and to assess their severity. This paper investigates the acoustic emissions associated with corona discharge (CD) from different types of sources in the time domain, and based on these it is used to detect, identify, and characterize the acoustic signals due to CD activity. Which usually takes place on polluted glass insulators used in high-voltage transmission lines and hence to differentiate abnormal operating conditions from normal ones. A laboratory experiment was conducted by preparing prototypes of the discharge. This study suggests a feature extraction and classification algorithm for CD classification. A wavelet signal processing toolbox is used to recover the CD acoustic signals by eliminating the noisy portion and to reduce the dimensions of the feature input vector. The proposed model is proven to characterize the PD activity with a high degree of integrity, which is attributed to the effect of the wavelet technique. The test results show that the proposed approach is efficient and reliable. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.       "

Amrani, et al.",2019,Modified Peek formula for calculating positive DC corona inception voltage on polluted insulator,10.1007/s00202-019-00797-7,"In this contribution, a mathematical model is proposed to predict the discharge inception voltage on polluted insulators under a non-uniform field of a high-voltage DC system. The present study is derived from the modified Peek’s law used for predicting the threshold voltage of a typical corona discharge. An onset criterion useful for practical electrode geometries was experimentally validated by considering insulators’ level of pollution along with the electro-geometrical parameters including inter-electrode distance, HV electrode radius, and width of the ground electrode. It was observed that the proposed mathematical model is much precise for smaller electrode radii and inter-electrode distances with higher conductivity of the pollution layer. Since prediction of the electrical onset on a polluted surface is of general interest for designing HV equipment suitable for heavily polluted regions in the world, it is hoped that the results presented can be viewed as a benchmark and a challenge for further research. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The establishment of a highly accurate PD diagnostic technique has become necessary in recent years. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed a phase-resolved PD signal using machine learning classification for different types of experimental electrode systems. A polyethylene sheet was used as the sample, and PD was generated by applying a high AC voltage to four different types of electrodes. The number of PD pulses was counted from the raw data as preprocessing to calculate the feature value for the machine learning. The PD generation rate was defined for each phase angle section. Four types of machine learning algorithms were adopted for the classification of the electrode system: k-NN (k-nearest neighbor algorithm), logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. The best accuracy was obtained by using the random forest algorithm (0.97), and it was found that k-NN also demonstrated good performance. The parameter dependencies were also evaluated for each algorithm. Based on the results generated by the random forest, it became clear that there were phase angle sections that were of high importance. The reason for the result was discussed from the perspective of (i) the difference due to the electrical circuit parameters (modified abc-model) and (ii) the stochastic fluctuation of PD signal. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Bajwa, et al.",2022,A novel approach towards predicting faults in power systems using machine learning,10.1007/s00202-021-01428-w,"Transmission lines are one of the most important components of a Power System. Overhead transmission lines run for hundreds of kilometres to supply power to the cities. At the same time, these lines are very susceptible to damage due to myriad reasons which include natural causes like particle contamination or technical reasons such as insulation failures, which do not immediately lead to a fault but lead to a phenomenon known as partial discharge (PD). Partial discharge is a localized dielectric breakdown which does not completely bridge the space between the two conductors in a small portion of a solid or liquid electrical insulation system under high voltage stress. Partial discharges slowly deteriorate the condition of the power line and, if left unrepaired, can lead to potential faults. Partial discharges are also a proven way of diagnosing the condition of power cables. This paper describes an approach towards detecting partial discharge signal patterns using machine learning algorithms and hence, predicting potential faults. The model described in this paper was able to detect PD patterns with 97% accuracy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.       "

Several machine learning (ML) approaches were used for PD classification in the past decades. However, ML techniques mainly depend upon feature extraction by human experts to train the model and clean PD data quantified in the HV laboratory. Still, in real-time circumstances, PD may occur in single and multiple PD patterns along with external interference. The deep convolution neural network (CNN) method is currently applicable for image classification. However, the challenging issue in the traditional CNN approaches is fine-tuning the hyperparameters with specific architecture. Thus, enhanced particle swarm optimization for hyperparameters tuning will reduce experts' manual trial and error method. Simultaneously, random minority and majority sampling approaches can overwhelm an imbalanced dataset problem. Results obtained by the ZFNet architecture compared with various pre-trained models like VGG19, AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet, whose hyperparameters were determined manually. The result shows that the proposed model achieves a 7.6% higher recognition rate than various deep learning approaches under a noisy environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Song, et al.",2023,Classification study of composite insulator chemical formulations based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy,10.1007/s00202-023-01771-0,"High-temperature vulcanized silicone rubber insulators are widely used in high-voltage transmission lines and substation equipment because of their excellent fouling resistance. The aging of silicone rubber occurs due to environmental factors as its operating life advances and is closely related to its production formulation. Establishing a classification method for insulator chemical formulations is beneficial regarding operational performance and proposing a more reasonable operating scheme for composite insulators. However, the silicone rubber production formulations of various manufacturers are usually confidential, and there is no technology that can quickly identify insulator chemical formulations. In this study, a rapid classification method for composite insulator chemical formulations was investigated based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Returned insulators from seven different manufacturers are considered as the research object. Spectral data were collected separately, and the insulators were initially classified using the characteristic spectral lines of the elements corresponding to different fillers doped in silicone rubber. The spectral data were characterized using a recursive feature elimination algorithm for feature selection and a linear discriminant algorithm for data dimensionality reduction in the characteristic spectral data. Accordingly, the insulators were classified using a backpropagation neural network algorithm, achieving the best experimental results with an accuracy of about 95%. Thus, LIBS technology can achieve rapid classification of insulator chemical formulations, which can provide a basis for formulation correlation for the operation and maintenance of composite insulators, as well as guarantee the safety of transmission lines. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

PD measurement is a diagnostic technique used for electrical insulating systems, and machine learning is needed to improve processing efficiency. However, the relationship between human insight and the learning model is unclear. The generated PD signals are first accumulated by each phase angle through applying a high AC voltage to four types of electrodes with a polyethylene sheet. Data are then converted to scatter images and classified using a CNN, with an accuracy rate of 98%. After cutting the data, including PD typical distribution, the classification demonstrates a slightly lower score of 95%. Finally, we divide the cut data into nine parts and choose whether to mask each part, then observe how the accuracy is affected. Results demonstrate that the CNN algorithm emphasizes specific parts of images. For example, when significant parts are contained, accuracy increases, and vice versa. In addition, the effect of noise on the insight and accuracy is partially revealed. It is clear from the results that appropriate parts need to be selected from big data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.       "

Hence, this paper presents a MATLAB/Simulink partial discharge (PD) capacitive model of five well-known PD defects: crack, contamination, air void, microcrack, and composite, found in insulation materials HV XLPE insulation. Furthermore, this work proposes an extraordinary deep learning approach utilizing short-time Fourier transform (STFT) scalograms to represent PD signals in the time-frequency domain and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify different PD defects.

Rajamayil, et al.",2024,A novel semi-supervised power transformer defect monitoring technique using unreliable pseudo-labels with highly imbalanced partial discharge signals,10.1007/s00202-024-02793-y,"In a high-voltage power transformer, one of the most important metrics to measure the effectiveness of an insulating system is partial discharges (PD). However, in real-world settings, several PD sources (single or multiple) with significant interference may hinder the signal’s acquisition, which could result in an erroneous final diagnosis of the equipment’s condition. Convolutional neural networks have outstanding classification performance and robust automatic feature extraction capabilities, making them adept at recognizing patterns. Nevertheless, the collected samples could be more balanced and a significant amount of unlabelled data, which complicates the ability of the existing approaches to provide accurate diagnoses. This study suggests three distinct sections for the transformer defect recognizing technique using unreliable pseudo-labels (TDRUPL), including teacher and student models, to address the abovementioned issues. A unique variational autoencoder first creates synthetic data to equalize the imbalanced samples. Then, external interference immersed in the measured PD signal is removed by employing a bi-directional long short-term memory network and its hyperparameters are tuned by genetic algorithm. Finally, to deal with unlabelled datasets, the instructor model in TDRUPL includes two separate classifiers that help to extract and classify PD characteristics. They also label some unlabelled data as noisy or noise-free samples for convenience. The student model dynamically modifies the conditional and marginal distribution to recognize transformer defects accurately.

Furthermore, the challenges and prospects of this method are discussed. The article delves into several aspects of CD diagnostic research, including detection mechanisms, development of detection tools, source determination, and severity evaluation. Furthermore, this article investigates the impact of different variables such as humidity, applied voltage, and gas pressure on corona discharges and how these factors influence diagnosis.

Metze, et al.",2020,Multivariate data analysis of capacitance frequency scanning for online monitoring of viable cell concentrations in small-scale bioreactors,10.1007/s00216-019-02096-3,"Viable cell concentration (VCC) is one of the most important process attributes during mammalian cell cultivations. Current state-of-the-art measurements of VCC comprise offline methods which do not allow for continuous process data. According to the FDA’s process analytical technology initiative, process monitoring and control should be applied to gain process understanding and to ensure high product quality. In this work, the use of an inline capacitance probe to monitor online VCCs of a mammalian CHO cell culture process in small-scale bioreactors (250 mL) was investigated. Capacitance sensors using single frequency are increasingly common for biomass monitoring. However, the single-frequency signal corresponds to the cell polarization that represents the viable cell volume. Therefore single-frequency measurements are dependent on cell diameter changes. Measuring the capacitance across various frequencies (frequency scanning) can provide information about the VCC and cope with changing cell diameter. Applying multivariate data analysis on the frequency scanning data successfully enabled direct online monitoring of VCCs in this study. The multivariate model was trained with data from 5 standard cultivations. The model provided a prediction of VCCs with relative errors from 5.5 to 11%, which is a good agreement with the acceptance criterion based on the offline reference method accuracy (approximately 10% relative error) and strongly improved compared with single-frequency results (16 to 23% relative error). Furthermore, robustness trials were conducted to demonstrate the model’s predictive ability under challenging conditions. The process deviations in regard to dilution steps and feed variations were detected immediately in the online prediction of the VCC with relative errors between 6.7 and 13.2%. Thus in summary, the presented method on capacitance frequency scanning demonstrates its suitability for process monitoring and control that can save batches, time, and cost.

Most existing online handwritten signature verification schemes usually choose the same feature sets for different users while comparing different signatures, which may reduce the stability of the dynamic characteristics. To avoid this problem, we propose a novel writer-dependent online signature verification technique based on Relief. For each user, our verification scheme falls into two phases: the training phase and the test phase. In the training phase, we select a signature as the base signature from real signatures and construct two different kinds of signature pairs: the real signature pairs and the forged signature pairs. Each pair of real signatures consists of two real signatures, and each pair of forgeries is made up of a real signature and a forgery. A group of combined features are defined for each pair of signatures. Then, we select more stable combined features by means of the Relief algorithm and compute a matrix used as a matching template, which contains the value of each combined feature for each pair of signatures. In the test phase, the classification of the pair of signatures composed of the test signature and the base reference signature is determined by the K-nearest neighbor. Experiments are conducted on our own database and SVC2004, and the results indicate that the method we propose here shows lower FAR and FRR than do traditional methods on the same databases. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

But, other phases such as γ″ and δ phases can precipitate in the microstructure, during aging at high temperatures. However, it is possible to minimize the formation of the Nb-rich Laves phases and therefore reduce the possibility of solidification cracking by adopting the appropriate welding conditions. This paper aims at the automatic microstructurally characterizing the kinetics of phase transformations on an Nb-base alloy, thermally aged at 650 and 950 °C for 10, 100 and 200 h, through backscattered ultrasound signals at frequency of 4 MHz and dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT)-based feature extraction technique. The feature set comprises of statistical attributes (such as variance, skewness and kurtosis) extracted from the complex wavelet coefficients which are obtained using the DTCWT decomposition of a backscattered ultrasound signal. Also, the performance of the proposed feature extraction technique is compared with the conventional discrete wavelet transform. Finally, these features are fed to the probabilistic neural network (PNN) and radial basis function classifiers to automatic microstructural classification. The training process of these networks depends on the selection of the smoothing parameter of the networks’ activation function in a hidden layer.

This proposed network structure is called extreme learning machine with autoencoding receptive fields (ELM-ARF), which has two parts including convolution feature extraction and feature coding. In the convolution feature extraction part, local features are extracted using orthogonalized local receptive fields. The ELM-AE theory and local receptive fields are used to encode the global receptive fields, which is used to extract global features. The pooled global features and local features are combined and input into the next layer. In the feature coding part, the shallow layer feature can be input to any deep layer through the ELM-ARF connection structure. A series of encodings are performed on the combined features in each layer to achieve a nonlinear mapping relationship from input information to target categories. In order to verify the validity of the structure, ELM-ARF is tested on four classic databases: USPS, MNIST, NORB and CIFAR10.

An effective way to maintain such systems is the measurement of partial discharges in the insulation material. Voids in solid dielectrics may result from many causes including defects taking place during the manufacturing of the dielectric. These voids induce PDs. Classifying different void sizes is challenging since traditional classification tools used for partial discharge (PD) classification do not work properly. For instance, phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns resulting from different void sizes will be roughly the same since the source of the partial discharge is the same. Using existing clustering techniques such as Time–Frequency (T–F) map or analysis of statistical features extracted from the PRPD patterns presents their own limitations. T–F map restricts the use of Fast Fourier Transform, while working with PRPDs is only applicable for AC measurements. In this paper, a convolutional neural network (CNN) attention-based model has shown superior capability over traditional classification technique (T–F map) to classify partial discharge (PD) waveforms resulting from different voids in PLA 3D-printed samples. 1D-CNN has classification accuracy of 98.7% with an increase of 21.42% compared to the T–F map technique. Extensive investigation of the learned model has been conducted in order to interpret the decisions made by the proposed neural network. In particular, adding an interpretable attention model such as GRAD-CAM to our CNN shows that while making the decision the neural network learns to focus more on the regions of the waveform corresponding to the rise of the pulse. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

The present paper presents the results of an investigation conducted to estimate the box-counting fractal dimension using 3D stochastic simulations of discontinuity networks generated by the SIMBLOC program. The first part presents the adopted algorithm whereas the second part is devoted to the application of the algorithm to three quarry sites: Klinthagen (Sweden), Eibenstein (Austria) and El Alto (Spain). The computed fractal dimension parameter is used as a measure of the irregularity of the discontinuity network at each site and to assess the differences between the three rock masses with regards to the discontinuity network density and joint size distribution. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

Roughness profile data was obtained from the borehole wall through scanning and analysis by using the model FAC40 The Graphic User Interface (GUI) to the WellCAD linked with the FAC40 Televiewer System was strengthened by adding three new functions. To establish a stable and reasonable fractal dimension, a suitable dividing ruler range must be applied. The use of the proper range ensured that accurate fractal dimensions were determined for each of Barton's ten standard roughness profiles. To estimate the JRC value of a joint, a BHTV image of a joint was picked from the borehole wall at the study site. The proposed technique is regarded as a very useful way to make an analysis as well as being able to overcome the several laborious steps requiring a significant amount of time.       "

Hayashi, et al.",2009,Roll of the rhythmic component in the proactive control of a human hand,10.1007/s10015-009-0730-x,"In terms of evolution, the strategy of catching prey would have been an important part of survival in a constantly changing environment. A prediction mechanism would have developed to compensate for any delay in the sensory-motor system. In a previous study, ""proactive control"" was found, in which the motion of the hands preceded the virtual moving target. These results implied that the positive phase shift of the hand motion represents the proactive nature of the visual-motor control system, which attempts to minimize the brief error in the hand motion when the target changes position unexpectedly. In our study, a visual target moves in circle (13 cm diameter) on a computer screen, and each subject is asked to keep track of the target's motion by the motion of a cursor. As the frequency of the target increases, a rhythmic component was found in the velocity of the cursor in spite of the fact that the velocity of the target was constant. The generation of a rhythmic component cannot be explained simply as a feedback mechanism for the phase shifts of the target and cursor in a sensory-motor system. Therefore, it implies that the rhythmic component was generated to predict the velocity of the target, which is a feed-forward mechanism in the sensory-motor system. Here, we discuss the generation of the rhythmic component and its roll in the feed-forward mechanism. © 2009 International Symposium on Artificial Life and Robotics (ISAROB).       "

The US database used in this study contained 69 breast masses (21 malignant and 48 benign masses) that at blinded retrospective interpretation were assigned to BI-RADS category 3 by at least one of five radiologists. For computer-aided analysis, multiple morphology (shape, orientation, margin, lesions boundary, and posterior acoustic features) and texture (echo patterns) features based on BI-RADS lexicon were implemented, and the binary logistic regression model was used for classification. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used for statistical analysis. The area under the curve (Az) of morphology, texture, and combined features were 0.90, 0.75, and 0.95, respectively. The combined features achieved the best performance and were significantly better than using texture features only (0.95 vs. 0.75, p value = 0.0163). The cut-off point at the sensitivity of 86 % (18/21), 95 % (20/21), and 100 % (21/21) achieved the specificity of 90 % (43/48), 73 % (35/48), and 33 % (16/48), respectively. In conclusion, the proposed CAD system has the potential to be used in upgrading malignant masses misclassified as BI-RADS category 3 on US by the radiologists. © 2013 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.

K. Adamiak,2006,Capillary and electrostatic limitations to the contact angle in electrowetting-on-dielectric,10.1007/s10404-006-0090-y,"The shape of a conducting liquid droplet placed on a hydrophobic dielectric surface is simulated numerically by solving the Laplace-Young capillary equation. The electric force, acting on the conducting surface, distorts the droplet shape leading to a change in the apparent contact angle; its variation is compared with a theoretical Young'Lippman prediction. At sufficiently large values of voltage, applied to the droplet, the numerical algorithm fails to converge, which is interpreted as the break-up of the droplet surface with small droplets being ejected from the surface. These highly charged droplets, as well as any other electric charges near the triple contact line, generated for example by the electric corona discharge, cause a change of the distribution of the electric forces. This effect can be helpful in explaining saturation of the apparent contact angle: an appropriately selected surface charge near the contact line can completely stop droplet distortion, and the contact angle variation, despite the increased droplet voltage. Furthermore, the simulation results show the effect of the permittivity of the medium surrounding the droplet, on the contact angle variation. © Springer-Verlag 2006.       "

In the first training-test data set used in the study, there were 230 X-ray images, of which 150 were Covid-19 and 80 were non-Covid-19, while in the second training-test data set there were 476 X-ray images, of which 150 were Covid-19 and 326 were non-Covid-19. Thus, classification results have been provided for two data sets, containing predominantly Covid-19 images and predominantly non-Covid-19 images, respectively. In the study, a 23-layer CNN architecture and a 54-layer CNN architecture were developed. Within the scope of the study, the results were obtained using chest X-ray images directly in the training-test procedures and the sub-band images obtained by applying dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to the above-mentioned images. The same experiments were repeated using images obtained by applying local binary pattern (LBP) to the chest X-ray images.

"S. Nannapaneni, et al.",2021,Online monitoring and control of a cyber-physical manufacturing process under uncertainty,10.1007/s10845-020-01609-7,"Recent technological advancements in computing, sensing and communication have led to the development of cyber-physical manufacturing processes, where a computing subsystem monitors the manufacturing process performance in real-time by analyzing sensor data and implements the necessary control to improve the product quality. This paper develops a predictive control framework where control actions are implemented after predicting the state of the manufacturing process or product quality at a future time using process models. In a cyber-physical manufacturing process, the product quality predictions may be affected by uncertainty sources from the computing subsystem (resource and communication uncertainty), manufacturing process (input uncertainty, process variability and modeling errors), and sensors (measurement uncertainty). In addition, due to the continuous interactions between the computing subsystem and the manufacturing process, these uncertainty sources may aggregate and compound over time. In some cases, some process parameters needed for model predictions may not be precisely known and may need to be derived from real time sensor data. This paper develops a dynamic Bayesian network approach, which enables the aggregation of multiple uncertainty sources, parameter estimation and robust prediction for online control. As the number of process parameters increase, their estimation using sensor data in real-time can be computationally expensive. To facilitate real-time analysis, variance-based global sensitivity analysis is used for dimension reduction. The proposed methodology of online monitoring and control under uncertainty, and dimension reduction, are illustrated for a cyber-physical turning process. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

"Z. Jiang, et al.",2024,A deep convolutional network combining layerwise images and defect parameter vectors for laser powder bed fusion process anomalies classification,10.1007/s10845-023-02183-4,"Defect detection is an essential way to ensure the quality of parts made by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and industrial cameras are one of the commonly used tools for defect monitoring. Different lighting environments affect the visibility of defects in the images, and the illumination condition becomes one of the most important factors affecting the defect detection effect of industrial cameras, but the modification of the equipment lighting environment will increase the complexity and cost of monitoring. In this study, only an off-axis CMOS camera monitoring system is used and the lighting facilities are not changed to improve the effect of defect detection under uneven lighting conditions. A dual-input convolutional neural network fusing defect parameter vectors and layerwise images is proposed for real-time online monitoring of defects in the LPBF process using a paraxial CMOS camera monitoring system. The model integrates the image and the parameter information related to defect generation, and can distinguish some defects that are not easily discerned by images alone. To a certain extent, it avoids the problem that the same defects are visually indistinguishable in images caused by uneven light distribution and reflections on metal surfaces. The results indicate that the method has better performance than the method with a single image input, with recognition accuracies above 80.00% for all defect categories. In addition, the method is more suitable for real-time online monitoring scenarios due to its low parameter number, short training time and fast prediction speed compared to classical deep learning algorithms. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

Mishra,2021,Video shot boundary detection using hybrid dual tree complex wavelet transform with Walsh Hadamard transform,10.1007/s11042-021-11052-2,"Shot boundary detection (SBD) is the initial process in the video analysis, indexing, summarization, and retrieval. Detection of correct transition from a video sequence and the feature extraction and their effectiveness of presenting the visual content of the video frames are the main factors in SBD. In this paper, the Hybrid Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform with Walsh Hadamard transform (DTCWT-WHT) and the optimized Deep belief network (DBN) are proposed for the SBD. A new feature extraction technique is developed for extracting the feature vector from each block of the image frames. Preprocessing is the initial step to remove the illumination noise in the video frames. In preprocessing, the Fast Averaging Peer Group filter is designed, and the significant feature of this filter is the computational efficiency. After preprocessing, the distance of the adjacent frame is computed using HSV color histogram distance. Hybrid approach is proposed to extract feature and the edge boundaries from the frames, and the continuity signal is constructed. Then, the extracted features are fed to the DBN for the classification process. Social ski driver optimization algorithm (SSDOA) is utilized to update the weights of DBN. Finally, this proposed method detects the abrupt (cut) and gradual (fade in and fade out) transitions from the video frames. Four well-known datasets such as TRECVID 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 datasets are utilized to examine the proposed framework. The capability of proposed work is reinforced by performing the comparison with the recent techniques.

The electrical system generates a transient homogeneous plasma, working under 400 mbar total pressure, with a 50 ns short current pulse at a repetition frequency up to a few Hz. The NO concentration at the exit of the reactor is quantified using absolute FTIR spectroscopy measurements, as a function of the specific deposited energy in the discharge and the mixture composition. Owing to the plasma homogeneity, the experimental results can be compared to predictions of a self-consistent 0-D discharge and kinetic model based on available data in the literature about reactions and their rate constants. It is shown that the addition of either propene (as for DBD or corona discharges) or n-decane to N 2/O 2/NO leads to an improvement of the NO removal as compared to the mixture without hydrocarbon molecules. The adopted kinetic schemes explain this effect for the two mixture types. On the other hand, both the experiments and model predictions emphasize that the addition of toluene does not lead to the improvement of NO conversion. Moreover, compounds that are useful for NO x reduction catalysis, such as aldehydes, are less produced in the mixture with toluene. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.       "

"Y. Xu, et al.",2009,Viewpoint invariant texture description using fractal analysis,10.1007/s11263-009-0220-6,"Image texture provides a rich visual description of the surfaces in the scene. Many texture signatures based on various statistical descriptions and various local measurements have been developed. Existing signatures, in general, are not invariant to 3D geometric transformations, which is a serious limitation for many applications. In this paper we introduce a new texture signature, called the multifractal spectrum (MFS). The MFS is invariant under the bi-Lipschitz map, which includes view-point changes and non-rigid deformations of the texture surface, as well as local affine illumination changes. It provides an efficient framework combining global spatial invariance and local robust measurements. Intuitively, the MFS could be viewed as a ""better histogram"" with greater robustness to various environmental changes and the advantage of capturing some geometrical distribution information encoded in the texture. Experiments demonstrate that the MFS codes the essential structure of textures with very low dimension, and thus represents an useful tool for texture classification. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) can be used for indicator and temporal domains respectively, but still lack the ability to represent complex patterns in surface water quality. Since attention mechanisms are designed to effectively focus on the most crucial information, spatial attention mechanism (SAM) and temporal attention mechanism (TAM) are suitable for dealing with the above multi-indicator and time series issues. This work incorporates SAM and TAM into the CNN-LSTM model to form 4 DL models for water quality prediction including CNN-LSTM, SAM-enhanced CNN-LSTM, TAM-enhanced CNN-LSTM, and the CNN-LSTM enhanced by both attention mechanisms. Four surface water online monitoring sites are used as case studies to examine the models in predicting three water quality indicators including dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and total organic carbon (TOC). According to the case results of the 4 models after training with similar training epochs, the prediction accuracies of attention-enhanced models are better than the CNN-LSTM model, and the model with both attention mechanisms generally achieves the best performance among the 4 models. The prediction NSE of DO by the four models are 0.817, 0.948, 0.952, and 0.967 respectively in a representative case Jiujiang. The results demonstrate that spatial and temporal attention can analyze correlations from multiple indicators and time series of water quality data respectively, to improve the accuracy of surface water quality prediction. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

EVestG data of 20 individuals with PD and 28 healthy controls were adopted from a previous study. The field potentials and their firing pattern in response to whole body tilt stimuli from both left and right ears were extracted. We investigated several statistical and fractal features of the field potentials and also their firing interval histograms followed by one-way analysis of variance to select pairs of features showing the most significant differences between individuals with Parkinson disease and the age-matched controls. Linear discriminant analysis classification was applied to every selected feature using a leave-one-out routine. The result of each feature's classifier was used in a heuristic average voting system to diagnose PD patients. The results show more than 95% accuracy for PD diagnosis. Given that the patients were at different stage of disease, the high accuracy of the results is encouraging for continuing exploration of the EVestG application to PD diagnosis as it may provide a quick and non-invasive screening tool. © International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering 2012.

However, some newly installed wind turbines may not have enough training data to fit an accurate power curve and lead to poor monitoring results. In this work, considering the insufficient data, we proposed a data expansion based on piecewise regression strategy to monitor the wind turbine with an incremental monitoring strategy. The proposed method can be divided into the offline modeling stage and the online monitoring stage. During offline modeling, a novel mapping function was first designed to expand the insufficient data by mapping the data of other data sets onto the insufficient target data set. In this way, there will be enough training data for the target wind turbine. Then, a piecewise modeling strategy was designed to condense the information of the expanded data into a small number of samples and then fit the power curve. Based on this strategy, the power curve can be accurately fitted with low computational complexity. During online monitoring, the power was predicted by the power curve, and finally, the operating condition can be monitored by comparing the prediction with the observed power. Meanwhile, an incremental learning strategy was proposed to improve both the prediction and monitoring accuracy by updating the power curve model using the newly arrived data. A real case in the experiment illustrated that the proposed monitoring method can accurately detect abnormal behavior with 92.77% detection accuracy while facing insufficient data. © 2023, Central South University.

Other 16 avocados were used to evaluate the firmness and mass loss. Three maturity stages of avocados were established, and a classification was obtained by applying principal component analysis and k-nearest neighbor algorithm. During the ripening process (12 days), avocado firmness decreased from 75.43 to 2.63 N, while skin color values kept invariable during 6 days after that, a decrement in the peel green color (a*) was observed (-9.68 to 2.32). Image features showed that during ripening the color parameters (L*, a*, and b*), entropy (4.29 to 4.00), angular second moment (0.287 to 0.360), and fractal dimension (2.58 to 2.44) had a similar path as compared to mass loss, a*, and firmness ripening parameters, respectively.

For classification and segmentation of MRI in this paper, we proposed a three-step framework. To remove noise the initial step utilizes a de-noising technique based on dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) test without affective the essential image features and content. In the second step, an un-supervised deep belief network (DBN) is intended for learning the unlabelled features. Here, the noise in MRI can cause a significant corruption of data that impedes the execution of DBNs. The DTCWT in the initial step enhances execution of DBNs. Additionally, we manage the issue of DBNs parameters fine-tuning by means of a quick meta-heuristic approach named salp swarm algorithm. Based on the simulation behaviour of salps this new meta-heuristic algorithm is planned to solve optimisation issues. It is validated against different benchmark test functions and afterward contrasted with well known state-of-the-art optimisation algorithms like genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimisation, bat algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm and cuckoo search algorithm for performance efficiency. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Khare, et al.",2021,Integration of complex wavelet transform and Zernike moment for multi‐class classification,10.1007/s12065-021-00575-0,"Multiclass object classification is a crucial problem in computer vision research and have different emerging applications such as video surveillance. The task of multiclass object classification has more challenges because of highly variable nature and real time processing requirement of data. For tackling the multiclass object classification task, several existing methods adopt one feature or combination of features to classify objects. In this work, we propose a new combination of features-based algorithm for object classification. In the combination, the two features: (1) Daubechies complex wavelet transform (DCxWT) and (2) Zernike moments (ZM) have been used. The shift-invariance and symmetry properties of DCxWT facilitate the object classification in the wavelet domain. Specifically, the shift-invariance property of DCxWT is effective for translated object representation whereas the symmetry property yields perfect reconstruction for retaining object boundaries (i.e., edges). Moreover, translation and rotation-invariance properties of ZM are especially beneficial for the representation of varying pose and orientation of the objects. For these reasons, the composite of the two features brings about significant synthesized benefits over each single feature and the other widely used features. The multi-class support vector machine classifier is used for classifying different objects. The proposed method has been tested on standard datasets as well as our own dataset prepared by authors of this paper. Experimental results demonstrated the significant outperformance of the proposed method through quantitative evaluations and also suggest that the proposed hybridization of features is preferable for the classification problem. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

The insulation of the high voltage power transformers are gradually deteriorated due to electrical, chemical and mechanical stresses caused by the partial discharges (PDs).

Thus the monitoring of PDs is essential for an early prediction of its life and advanced maintenance. In this paper, direct optical partial discharge detection (DOPDD) technique is used to monitor the PDs in a dielectric test cell, which is considered to be a laboratory model of a high voltage power transformer.

Zeng, et al.",2023,Probabilistic damage detection using a new likelihood-free Bayesian inference method,10.1007/s13349-022-00638-5,"Bayesian inference plays a vital role in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by assessing structural integrity through probabilistic model updating using monitoring data. A crucial component in Bayesian inference is the evaluation of the likelihood function. For some situations, the likelihood function is not available in closed form or is analytically intractable, due to either a computationally intractable forward model solution or lack of measurements for some inputs. While likelihood-free Bayesian inference methods such as approximate Bayesian computation have been proposed to tackle this issue, the required computational effort is high, and the accuracy relies on similarity criteria, which makes these methods unsuitable for online monitoring. This study investigates a novel likelihood-free and computationally efficient Bayesian inference method, named BayesFlow, for probabilistic damage inference in SHM through model updating. It consists of a training phase and an online monitoring phase. In the training phase, BayesFlow approximates the posterior distributions of structural parameters by jointly training a conditional invertible neutral network (cINN) and a summary network. The cINN connects structural parameters with a latent of the posterior distribution. The summary network automatically learns the maximally informative statistics for model updating from data of output variables rather than hand-crafted features. In the online monitoring phase, BayesFlow directly predicts the posterior distribution for any given observations, without computing any likelihood or evaluating the forward prediction model, and thereby allows for real-time monitoring. Two benchmark examples, including an 18-story steel frame and a concrete building frame, are used to demonstrate the proposed method. Results comparison of the proposed method and the Differential Evolutionary Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) sampling method demonstrates advantages of the proposed method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

It is also marked as a new development by learning from examples based on neural networks, radial basis function and splines or other functions. Here least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is used as a machine learning technique for the prediction of the breakdown voltage of solid insulator. The breakdown voltage is due to partial discharge of five solid insulating materials under ac condition. That has been predicted as a function of four input parameters such as thickness of insulating samples ‘t’, diameter of void ‘d’, the thickness of the void ‘t1’ and relative permittivity of materials ‘εr’ by using the LS-SVM model. From experimental studies performed on cylindrical-plane electrode system, the requisite training data is obtained. The voids with different dimension are artificially created. Detailed studies have been carried out to determine the LS-SVM parameters which give the best result. At the completion of training it is found that the LS-SVM model is capable of predicting the breakdown voltage Vb = (t, t1, d, εr) very efficiently and with a small value of the mean absolute error. © 2013, The Institution of Engineers (India).

Therefore, it is necessary to use appropriate monitoring methods and mathematical models to effectively monitor and predict the residual subsidence caused by underground mining. Compared with traditional level survey and InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) technology, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) online monitoring technology has the advantages of long-term monitoring, high precision and more flexible monitoring methods. The empirical equation method of residual subsidence in mining subsidence is effectively combined with the rock creep equation, which can not only describe the residual subsidence process from the mechanism, but also predict the residual subsidence. Therefore, based on GNSS online monitoring technology, combined with the mining subsidence model of mountain area and adding the correlation coefficient of the compaction degree of caving broken rock and the Kelvin model of rock mechanics, this paper constructs the residual subsidence time series model of arbitrary point on the ground in mountain area. Through the example, the predicted results of the model in the inversion parameter phase and the dynamic prediction phase are compared with the measured data sequence. The results show that the model can carry out effective numerical calculation according to the GNSS monitoring data of any point on the ground, and the model prediction effect is good, which provides a new method for the prediction of residual subsidence in mountain mining. © The Author(s) 2024.

Computer-aided emotion recognition using physiological signals remains a challenging task in “affective computing”. In this paper, the entropy-based complex wavelet sub-bands (ECWS) measures are suggested for the classification of 14 emotion categories from the photoplethysmograph (PPG). Methods: PPG data available at DEAP (a Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals) were selected when subjects were watching the fun, exciting, joy, happy, cheerful, love, sentimental, melancholy, sad, depressing, mellow, hate, shock, and terrible music videos. Using the dual-tree complex wavelet transforms, each PPG signal was decomposed into six levels. Four entropy measures, including approximate entropy, sample entropy, permutation entropy, and the improved multi-scale permutation entropy, were extracted from each sub-band coefficient.

This study is concerned with the design of an ensemble neural networks based on fuzzy rules and the enhancement of its recognition capability with the aid of preprocessing technologies and multi-feature fusion strategy. The key points are summarized as follows: (1) principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm are utilized to reduce the dimensionality of input space as well as extracting features. (2) statistical characteristics (SC) are obtained as the complementary characteristics of the PD. (3) the proposed network architecture consists of two-branch radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) based on fuzzy rules, which can effectively reflect the distribution of the input data. Two types of RBFNN are designed which are based on hard c-means (HCM) and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering respectively.

At present, the pattern recognition of partial discharge (PD) in a transformer has the problem of the insufficient generalization ability of the classifier due to scarcity and imbalance of samples, resulting in low recognition accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a pattern recognition of the PD method based on information maximizing generative adversarial nets (InfoGAN) and convolutional neural networks. In this method, phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) maps, constructed from pulse current waveforms, are chosen as the training samples. First, the InfoGAN is trained to generate new samples which expanded the original sample database, then various classifiers are trained by using the expanded sample database to realize the pattern recognition. Results of the test show that the proposed method can generate new highly similar samples more stable than other data enhancement methods, and effectively enrich the data diversity. In addition, the classifier trained by the expanded sample database has better generalization ability and is applicable to different classifiers, while residual network 18 has the highest recognition rate of 99.0%.

The dielectric walls used in the deposition experiments, poly(vinyl chloride) or polytetrafluoroethylene disks, are prepared to have known uniform surface charge distributions by using a corona discharge procedure. This avoids any effects on deposition caused by nonuniformity of the surface charge. The surface charge densities are based on measurements of the surface voltage in the center of the sample. Deposition experiments using a turbulently-mixed stirred tank demonstrate that particle deposition rates to the wall decrease as the sample's thickness increases or its relative permittivity decreases, even at a constant surface voltage. The electric field over the sample wall is calculated using the surface charge density, and the convection-diffusion equations describing particle deposition by Brownian and turbulent diffusion and electric migration are solved numerically. The calculated deposition rates agree well with those measured, indicating that quantitative prediction of particle deposition is possible if the surface charge, material, thickness and the effect of adjacent walls are taken into account. © 1992.

The procedure assumes that discrete charged shells are liberated during the pulsed discharge. The charged shells are moved in increments in the inter-electrode space depending on the local field calculated using the superposition theorem and assuming static conditions. The predictions of charge per pulse and current-voltage characteristics are compared with laboratory measurements with sinusoidal pulses. Fairly good agreement between theory and experiment is observed. It is seen that the charge per pulse is dependent rather on the peak pulse voltage than on the pulse width in the range of 100 to 300 μs investigated here. Due to the space charge quenching effect, the discharge is observed to cease near the pulse peak as predicted by the theoretical model. From the measurements with a wire-plate geometry, it is seen that the current distribution on the plate perpendicular to the discharge wire is not much altered by theapplication pulsed voltage but the discharge along the length of the wire is observed to be much more uniform compared with DC.

However, most existing models are restricted to offline modeling, which cannot continuously track the displacement behavior with dynamic evolution patterns, especially in time-varying environments. In this paper, sequential learning is introduced to establish an online monitoring model for dam displacement behavior. This approach starts by considering the timeliness difference between old and new data using the forgetting mechanism, and a novel adaptive forgetting extreme learning machine (AF-ELM) is presented. A primary predictor based on AF-ELM is then formulated, which aims to sequentially learn the complex nonlinear relationship between dam displacement and main environmental factors. Considering the chaotic characteristics contained in the residual sequence of the primary predictor, a multi-scale residual-error correction (REC) strategy is devised based on divide-and-conquer scheme. Specifically, time-varying filter-based empirical mode decomposition is adopted to decompose the raw chaotic residual-error series into a set of subseries with more stationarity, which are further aggregated and reconstructed by fuzzy entropy theory and suitable approximation criterion. Finally, the corrected residual sequence is superimposed with the preliminary predictions from AF-ELM to generate the required modeling results. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified and assessed by taking a real concrete dam as an example and comparing prediction performance with state-of-the-art models. The results show that AF-ELM performs better in displacement prediction compared with benchmark models, and the multi-scale REC can effectively identify the valuable information within the residual sequence.

The results suggested that the relationship between experimentally measured soil water content (θm) and εa was strongly linear (0.911<R2<0.997). The most accurate results were provided by the multi-point calibration method. Moreover, for the case of non-conductive soils, Kelleners's method provides similar εa values with CS655 sensor readings for a maximum σb value of about 0.8 dS m−1. Concerning the use of empirical calibration equations, which include the effect of bulk electrical conductivity in εa, the obtained results suggest that the equation θ=aεa+b+cσb has a strong physical basis and adequate performance (RMSE<0.03 m3 m-3). Finally, the investigation of the εa-σb relationship revealed that it is strongly linear and that slope mainly depends on the pore water electrical conductivity (σp), which is closely related to the soil solution salinity in contact with plant roots that influences plants growth. The Malliki-Walzcak model provide more reliable σp predictions as compared to the Hilhorst model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.       "

Navarro, et al.",2009,Universality of fractal dimension on time-independent Hamiltonian systems,10.1016/j.amc.2009.04.014,"This paper summarizes a numerical study of the dependence of the fractal dimension on the energy of certain open Hamiltonian systems, which present different kind of symmetries. Owing to the presence of chaos in these systems, it is not possible to make predictions on the way and the time of escape of the orbits starting inside the potential well. This fact causes the appearance of fractal boundaries in the initial-condition phase space. In order to compute its dimension, we use a simple method based on the perturbed orbits' behavior. The results show that the fractal dimension function depends on the structure of the potential well, contrary to other properties, such us the probability of escape, which has already been postulated as universal in earlier papers (see for instance [C. Siopis, H.E. Kandrup, G. Contopoulos, R. Dvorak, Universal properties of escape in dynamical systems, Celest. Mech. Dyn.

Kundu, et al.",2012,Identification of two simultaneous partial discharge sources in an oil-pressboard insulation system using acoustic emission techniques,10.1016/j.apacoust.2011.11.004,"Insulation failure is one of the major causes of catastrophic failure of transformers. It is established that partial discharge (PD) causes insulation degradation and premature failure of insulation. In power apparatus, more than one PD source may be active simultaneously. The nature of insulation degradation for multiple PD sources is different from that due to single PD source. Therefore, it will be helpful for severity assessment of insulation degradation, if the number of active PD sources are identified and classified. This paper presents a method for identification and classification of two simultaneously active PD sources using acoustic emission techniques. The acoustic emission (AE) signals are measured for laboratory simulated PD in an oil-pressboard insulation system for three different electrode systems. The measurements of partial discharge acoustic emission (PDAE) signals are carried out for single PD source and for two simultaneous PD sources. The measured signals are analyzed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), box counting fractal dimension and lacunarity. Box counting fractal dimension and lacunarity are calculated for DWT decomposed signal of major frequency band. Energy distribution in different frequency bands of DWT decomposed signal along with box counting fractal dimension and lacunarity is used for classification of two simultaneous PD sources. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"F. Du, et al.",2022,Investigation into the transmission of guided waves across bolt jointed plates,10.1016/j.apacoust.2022.108866,"Bolt joints are extensively used in aerospace and civil engineering. Online monitoring of bolt looseness is crucial to ensure the function and safety of these structures. Understanding the interaction between guided waves and the joint interfaces can aid in the design and optimization of such monitoring systems, and hence becomes important. However, the influence of contact area on guided wave energy passing through these jointed plates is still not clear. In this paper, a semi-analytic method, which combines finite element models with a wave superposition method, is proposed to predict the transmission of guided waves in joint interfaces. The wave mode conversions in the contact area are included. The model was validated by comparison with independent finite element models. In addition, the influence of the contact length on transmission coefficients of guided waves passing through the joint interface is investigated. The results were experimentally validated by wire electrical discharge machined specimens with various contact areas. Then, the transmitted guided wave and the contact area in a bolt jointed plate under different torques were measured experimentally and compared with the present method. The results of the two different experiments agree well with those predicted using the semi-analytic method, respectively. In particular, the experimental results of the bolt jointed plate show that the direct S0 wave packet energy decreases with the bolt preload, which can be explained by the proposed model. Thus, the proposed semi-analytic method demonstrates efficiency in the prediction of the power transmission coefficient and has potential applications in the selection of excitation frequencies in the online monitoring of jointed structures. On this basis, a normalized power transmission coefficient can be directly calculated by the energy of the first S0 wave packet in the received signal to monitor bolt torque. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd       "

Li, et al.",2018,Identification of optimal operating strategy of direct air-cooling condenser for Rankine cycle based power plants,10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.10.081,"Direct air-cooling condenser has attracted significant attention in the last decade due to the employment of Rankine-cycle based power plants from renewable (e.g., concentrated solar) or traditional (e.g., coal) heat sources in water-scarce areas. The optimal operating strategy of direct air-cooling condenser to maximize net power gain under given plant status and boundary conditions is rather complicated due to strong impacts from the steam turbine subsystem and varying ambient conditions. This paper aims at determining, for various boundary conditions, the optimal operating fan frequency and the corresponding back pressure of a typical large-scale air-cooled coal-fired power plant via accurate off-design models of both the turbine subsystem and air-cooling condenser, which are derived by combining aggregated physical equations and real operating data. Several data pre-processing techniques, e.g., quasi steady-state selection, are employed first to improve the data quality. Then, the processed data are divided into two parts for the performance characterization of involved equipment and the accuracy testing of the derived models, respectively. The results show that good agreement has been achieved between the prediction of the established models and the real operating data within a wide range of load factor (50–100%), and ambient temperature (10–30 °C). To maximize the plant profit, practical and quantitative operating guidelines of the air fans have been derived, which are further employed to examine current operating strategy of the air-cooling condenser of the considered power plant. It is found that with a load factor over 85%, even the full-load operation of all equipped air fans cannot deliver the theoretical optimal back pressure for the steam turbine subsystem, indicating potential benefits of enlarging the condenser for high operating loads. The proposed identification procedure can be easily implemented as an online monitoring and supervision system to practically assist the optimal plant operation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd       "

Trianni, et al.",2019,Energy efficiency measures in electric motors systems: A novel classification highlighting specific implications in their adoption,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113481,"Electric motor systems (EMS) cover a remarkable share of industrial power consumption. Despite the wide set of apparently cost-effective opportunities to improve energy efficiency in this cross-cutting technology, often decision-makers do not take them, as the detail for a specific decision can be too high, resulting in an implementation rate quite low. In particular, little knowledge of the features that should be considered when deciding to undertake an action in this area represents a serious hurdle. In many cases, information regarding the characteristics of such energy efficiency measures (EEMs) is quite vague. For this reason, in the present study, we present a thorough overview of EEMs for EMS, basing on an extensive review of scientific and industrial literature. By highlighting their characteristics and productivity benefits, most of which impacting on the adoption decision-making process, we re-categorise EEMs for EMS, offering specific detail over single EEMs and thus support to industrial decision-makers. EEMs are presented according to four main groups, as follows: hardware, motor system drives, management of motors in the plant, and power quality. The novel classification is helpful to support research for the development of a new framework to represent the main factors that affect the adoption of EEMs for EMS. Further, it may help the identification and quantification of productivity benefits for those EEMs. Finally, it could result in a valuable tool offering different perspectives in the decision-making of industrial managers and technology suppliers, as well as industrial policy-makers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd       "

A novel approach for health management online monitoring of lithium-ion batteries based on mechanism modeling and data-driven fusion is proposed in this paper. An improved semi-empirical capacity degradation model of the lithium-ion batteries fully considering internal resistance and temperature is established. After the data sets of the lithium-ion batteries are de-noised by the wavelet packet, the parameters of the model are identified according to the genetic algorithm and a particle filter framework is designed to online update the parameters of the model. Through the fusion of the two, the remaining useful life and state of health of the lithium-ion batteries can be predicted accurately. The proposed method is verified by the battery cycle test data from the Advanced Life Cycle Engineering Center of University of Maryland and the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence, the mean absolute error and root mean square error of the remaining useful life for the lithium-ion batteries are respectively less than 20 and 25 cycles at constant temperature condition, and respectively less than 3.30 and 3.60 cycles at non-constant temperature condition. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy and better fitting performance, which can provide a certain theoretical basis for the safe operation of lithium-ion batteries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd       "

It is shown that the broadband forcing yields a transfer of energy between the parts of the spectrum so that the spectrum becomes progressively more narrow-band for each level of the tree-like structure in the direction of the stem. We show that this behavior is in contrast to the response of a linear oscillator, which simply filters out the harmonics away from the resonance. We term such behavior “regularization” and examine its significance for two- and three-dimensional motion using a Lagrangian framework. Key to our analysis is to investigate the dependence of the spectrum of motion, and its narrowing, on the parameters of the tree-like structure, for instance the lengths of different branches. Model predictions are obtained for idealized wind forcing characterized by an airflow that is interrupted at random time intervals. Our numerically-derived results are then compared against the data collected from select analogue laboratory experiments, which confirm the robust nature of the vibration regularization. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The next goal was to review and compare a large number of measures to find the suitable candidates for the study of sleep onset and sleep evolution. Methods and material: A huge number of characteristics, including relevant simple measures in time domain, characteristics of distribution, linear spectral measures, measures of complexity and interdependency measures were computed for polysomnographic recordings of 20 healthy subjects. Summarily, all-night evolutions of 818 measures (73 characteristics for various channels and channel combinations) were analysed and compared with visual scorings of experts (hypnograms). Our tests involved classification of the data into five classes (waking and four sleep stages) and 10 classification tasks to distinguish between two specific sleep stages. To discover measures of the best decision-making ability, discriminant analysis was done by Fisher quadratic classifier for one-dimensional case. Results and conclusions: The most difficult decision problem, between S1 and REM sleep, were best managed by measures computed from electromyogram led by fractal exponent (classification error 23%). In the simplest task, distinction between wake and deep sleep, the power ratio between delta and beta band of electroencephalogram was the most successful measure (classification error 1%). Delta/beta ratio with mean classification error 42.6% was the best single-performing measure also in discrimination between all five stages. However, the error level shows impossibility to satisfactorily separate the five sleep stages by a single measure. Use of a few additional characteristics is necessary. Some novel measures, especially fractal exponent and fractal dimension turned up equally successful or even superior to the conventional scoring methods in discrimination between particular states of sleep. They seem to provide a very promising basis for automatic sleep analysis particularly in conjunction with some of the successful spectral standards. © 2008.       "

The outcomes show that the SASW method is able to identify the surface wave velocity which coincides with the dynamic stiffness parameters of Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) slabs. The values of surface wave velocity increased during the curing stage, and in situ measurement of wave velocity could be helpful in determining the degree of curing.

Firstly, the central region of the Y-color channel is extracted, and the watermark is embedded into the low-frequency component by dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). A synchronization correction technique based on the MLP model is used prior to the watermark extraction. When the MLP model is trained, the position and scale parameters of the Cauchy distribution are employed to generate the image feature vector after first calculating the quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) of the original color host image. The new 3D hyperchaotic mapping is used during the algorithmic process to increase security, which is employed for scrambling, encryption, and embedding of watermarks, respectively.

Ignjatovic, et al.",2014,The influence of the breakdown electric field in the configuration of lightning corona sheath on charge distribution in the channel,10.1016/j.atmosres.2014.01.004,"A model of corona sheath that surrounds the thin core of the lightning channel has been investigated by using a generalized traveling current source return stroke model. The lightning channel is modeled by a charged corona sheath that stretches around a highly conductive central core through which the main current flows. The channel core with the negatively charged outer channel sheath forms a strong electric field, with an overall radial orientation. The return stroke process is modeled as the negative leader charge in the corona sheath being discharged by the positive charge coming from the channel core. Expressions that describe how the corona sheath radius evolves during the return stroke are obtained from the corona sheath model, which predicts charge motion within the sheath. The corona sheath model, set forth by Maslowski and Rakov (2006), Tausanovic et al. (2010), Marjanovic and Cvetic (2009), Cvetic et al. (2011) and Cvetic et al. (2012), divides the sheath onto three zones: zone 1 (surrounding the channel core with net positive charge), zone 2 (surrounding zone 1 with negative charge) and zone 3 (the outer zone, representing uncharged virgin air). In the present study, we have assumed a constant electric field inside zone 1, as suggested by experimental research of corona discharges in coaxial geometry conducted by Cooray (2000). The present investigation builds upon previous studies by Tausanovic et al. (2010) and Cvetic et al. (2012) in several ways. The value of the breakdown electric field has been varied for probing its effect on channel charge distribution prior and during the return stroke. With the aim of investigating initial space charge distribution along the channel, total electric field at the outer surface of the channel corona sheath, just before the return stroke, is calculated and compared for various return stroke models. A self-consistent algorithm is applied to the generalized traveling current source return stroke model, so that the boundary condition for total electric field is fulfilled. The new density of space charge and the new radius of channel corona envelope, immediately before the return stroke stage, are calculated. The obtained results indicate a strong dependence of channel charge distribution on the breakdown electric field value. Among the compared return stroke models, transmission-line-type models have exhibited a good agreement with the predictions of the Gauss' law regarding total breakdown electric field on the corona sheath's outer surface. The generalized lightning traveling current source return stroke model gives similar results if the adjustment of the space charge density inside the corona sheath is performed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Tetramethrin and bifenthrin were analyzed simultaneously using corona discharge IMS. Under the optimized experimental conditions, bifenthrin and tetramethrin showed one and three peaks, respectively. The bifenthrin peak was completely overlapped with the last one of tetramethrin peak. A three way data structure (sample × acquisition time × drift time) was constructed and it was then decomposed by Tucker 3 model to loading matrices and a three-way core array. Tucker 3 was applied, because of a lack of trilinearity in the three way data array and interactions between loading vectors. Tucker 3 models with different numbers of loading vectors were constructed and the model with 5 (sample), 5 (acquisition time), and 3 (drift time) loading vectors was selected as the suitable model. The statistical parameters including root mean squared error of calibration (RMSE) and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) were calculated for the model, which were found to be 4.46, 4.95μg mL -1 for tetramethrin and 3.23, 6.4μg mL -1 for bifenthrin, respectively.

Karthick, et al.",2020,Could we have missed out the seizure onset: A study based on intracranial EEG,10.1016/j.clinph.2019.10.011,"Objective: Intracranial EEG covers only a small fraction of brain volume and it is uncertain if a discharge represents a true seizure onset or results from spread. We therefore assessed if there are differences between characteristics of the ictal onset when we are likely to have a true onset, and characteristics of the discharge in regions of spread. Methods: Wavelet based statistical features were extracted in 503 onset and 390 spread channels of 58 seizures from 20 patients. These features were used as predictors in models based on machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbour, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, random and rotation forest. Results: Statistical features (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) associated with all wavelet scales were significantly higher in onset than in spread channels. The best classifier, random forest, achieved accuracy of 79.6% and precision of 82%. Conclusions: The signals associated with onset and spread regions exhibit different characteristics. The proposed features are able to classify the signals with good accuracy. Significance: Using our classifier on new seizures could help clinicians gain confidence in having recorded the real seizure onset or on the contrary be concerned that the true onset may have been missed. © 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology       "
M. Peker,2016,A new approach for automatic sleep scoring: Combining Taguchi based complex-valued neural network and complex wavelet transform,10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.01.001,"Automatic classification of sleep stages is one of the most important methods used for diagnostic procedures in psychiatry and neurology. This method, which has been developed by sleep specialists, is a time-consuming and difficult process. Generally, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used in sleep scoring. In this study, a new complex classifier-based approach is presented for automatic sleep scoring using EEG signals. In this context, complex-valued methods were utilized in the feature selection and classification stages. In the feature selection stage, features of EEG data were extracted with the help of a dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). In the next phase, five statistical features were obtained. These features are classified using complex-valued neural network (CVANN) algorithm. The Taguchi method was used in order to determine the effective parameter values in this CVANN. The aim was to develop a stable model involving parameter optimization. Different statistical parameters were utilized in the evaluation phase. Also, results were obtained in terms of two different sleep standards. In the study in which a 2nd level DTCWT and CVANN hybrid model was used, 93.84% accuracy rate was obtained according to the Rechtschaffen & Kales (R&K) standard, while a 95.42% accuracy rate was obtained according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standard.

Pereira, et al.",2016,A new computer vision-based approach to aid the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease,10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.08.005,"Background and Objective Even today, pointing out an exam that can diagnose a patient with Parkinson's disease (PD) accurately enough is not an easy task. Although a number of techniques have been used in search for a more precise method, detecting such illness and measuring its level of severity early enough to postpone its side effects are not straightforward. In this work, after reviewing a considerable number of works, we conclude that only a few techniques address the problem of PD recognition by means of micrography using computer vision techniques. Therefore, we consider the problem of aiding automatic PD diagnosis by means of spirals and meanders filled out in forms, which are then compared with the template for feature extraction. Methods In our work, both the template and the drawings are identified and separated automatically using image processing techniques, thus needing no user intervention. Since we have no registered images, the idea is to obtain a suitable representation of both template and drawings using the very same approach for all images in a fast and accurate approach. Results The results have shown that we can obtain very reasonable recognition rates (around ≈67%), with the most accurate class being the one represented by the patients, which outnumbered the control individuals in the proposed dataset. Conclusions The proposed approach seemed to be suitable for aiding in automatic PD diagnosis by means of computer vision and machine learning techniques. Also, meander images play an important role, leading to higher accuracies than spiral images. We also observed that the main problem in detecting PD is the patients in the early stages, who can draw near-perfect objects, which are very similar to the ones made by control patients. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd       "

Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the adaptive linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used for classification of left- and right-hand MI data and for simultaneous and continuous update of its parameters. In addition to the original use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, the 2D anisotropic Gaussian filter is proposed to further refine the selection of active segments. The multiresolution fractal features are then extracted from wavelet data by means of modified fractal dimension. The classification in session 2 is performed by adaptive LDA, which is trial-by-trial updated using the Kalman filter after the trial is classified.

ECG signal analysis carried out using computer-aided techniques can speed up the diagnosis process and aid in the proper management of CHF patients. Therefore, in this work, dual tree complex wavelets transform (DTCWT)-based methodology is proposed for an automated identification of ECG signals exhibiting CHF from normal. In the experiment, we have performed a DTCWT on ECG segments of 2 s duration up to six levels to obtain the coefficients. From these DTCWT coefficients, statistical features are extracted and ranked using Bhattacharyya, entropy, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), receiver-operating characteristics (ROC), Wilcoxon, t-test and reliefF methods. Ranked features are subjected to k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and decision tree (DT) classifiers for automated differentiation of CHF and normal ECG signals. We have achieved 99.86% accuracy, 99.78% sensitivity and 99.94% specificity in the identification of CHF affected ECG signals using 45 features.

However, the complexity of the operational environment and the similarity of PD signals make defect identification challenging. Consequently, this paper proposes a Time-domain Local Correlation Entropy Image (T-LCEI) transformation method, which constructs an entropy matrix to convert raw PD signals into images. These images embed feature and bandwidth information from the original PD data, significantly enhancing the ability to differentiate between similar PD signals. Furthermore, the method combines a Dual Attention Convolutional Neural Network (DA_CNN) for the effective classification of correlation entropy images. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves an average classification accuracy of 99.69% across four typical PD defect datasets, with a testing accuracy of 97.75% in practical scenarios. Compared to existing PD detection methods, T-LCEI offers significant improvements in effectiveness and discriminability. The integration of DA_CNN further enhances recognition accuracy.

Given a set of inspections with known inspection costs and error probabilities of two types (classifying conforming items as non-conforming and vice versa), the goal is to find a sequenced subset of inspections that maximizes the expected overall profit, taking into account the revenue from delivering conforming items, the penalty of delivering non-conforming ones, and the overall cost of the inspections used. Our model allows an additional degree of freedom, in comparison to prior work in this domain, enabling the selection of inspections sequence along the selection of which inspections to use. We present an efficient branch and bound algorithm for finding the optimal solution, and two types of heuristics: greedy-based and preliminary sort-based, differing in their accuracy and calculation time. The optimal and heuristic methods are extensively evaluated, using a factorial experimental design that includes 65 610 problem instances. For each instance we compared the methods performance in terms of reaching optimality, deviation from the optimal solution and calculation-time. The results reflect a substantial influence of the sequence over the expected profit. An interesting finding is that the suggested preliminary sort-based heuristics achieve a relatively accurate solution in a reasonable calculation-time and outperform the commonly used greedy-based heuristics. The usefulness of the different methods is illustrated using sample problems from the biometric inspection security domain. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.       "

First, a non-uniform pollution layer artificially created for HV insulator with three straight shed ball end fitting in a laboratory setup and corresponding PD readings are measured. The wavelet transform is employed to represent the measured PD signal as scalogram patterns. In general CNN uses a single input pattern for feature extraction. If the pattern quality is low, it is easy to cause misclassification. Hence in this proposed work, the feature fusion of a dual-input Visual Geometry Group (VGG) based CNN is used for the classification of contamination layer. VGG 19 is a pretrained deep learning network used for extracting the rich features from the patterns. In continuation to that, hyperparameter (HP) play a vital role in deep learning algorithms because they directly manage the behaviours of training algorithms and have a significant effect on the performance of deep learning models. Hence, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is used for tuning the HP. At last, to check the practicality of the proposed algorithm, a new dataset is created for 11 kV polymer insulator with three alternate shed clevis end fitting and different pollution levels—acceptable results obtained by using dual-input CNN with the minimum quantity of data. © 2021 The Authors       "

Jones,2008,"On corona-induced gas motion and heating I: Field equations, modelling and vortex formation",10.1016/j.elstat.2007.08.004,"Corona discharges generate ionic currents that flow from the glow into the inter-electrode space. These spatial currents force the gas through which they travel into motion, as the collisions between the ions and the neutral gas molecules transfer momentum and the energy of the electric field driving the ions to the gas. The transfer of momentum causes the gas to accelerate in the direction of the electric field; and the energy transfer results in gas heating and buoyancy forces. The governing field equations for the phenomenon are reviewed which describe the variations in gas temperature, velocity, density and pressure in terms of the rates of ionic momentum and electrical energy transfer. Boundary conditions are also considered with small-scale negative point-plane DC discharges in air in mind, and the order of magnitude of the terms in the equations is assessed for such situations. In this first paper of a two-part study, numerical solutions are not sought, but the situation is modelled using the known experimental facts for these discharges. The gas flow is shown to be dominated by the momentum transfer terms rather than the buoyancy terms, and resembles an entrained jet passing down the shank of the point electrode before leaving the tip and impinging on the plane. Transition from the Trichel pulse regime to the continuous glow with the central-channel heating that precedes breakdown is considered using vortex formation and shedding from the point electrode. Theoretical temperature predictions are in accord with experimental measurements. Previously discovered empirical laws describing the transition are discussed and it is shown that these may be explained by the transition of the flow to turbulence at a critical Reynolds number. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The current-voltage characteristics of the AHPC setup are measured. The current on the bag plate has a mean value 7.82 μA without the perforated plate and 0.08 μA with the perforated plate for the measured voltages. The total currents are used to calculate the charge density at the corona wire according to the Peek's formula. For both cases, the numerical predictions of the current-voltage relations of the plates of the model AHPC agree well with the measurements. When the AHPC has the perforated plate, numerical results show that the electric field and space charge density distributions on the perforated plate have the same number of peaks corresponding to the holes. The electric field on the bag plate surface is lower than that of the top plate and the perforated plate. Though the bag plate has low current, its surface still has high space charge density.

Therefore, accurately determining real-time battery degradation is of paramount importance. This study presents a digital twin framework for analyzing and predicting LIB degradation performance. Within this framework, the back propagation neural network (BPNN) is employed to predict and complete the partial discharge voltage curve of the actual battery cycle. Building upon this, in conjunction with the battery's state of charge (SOC), the convolutional neural networks-long short term memory-attention (CNN-LSTM-Attention) model is utilized to real-time forecast the maximum available capacity of LIBs and reveal the battery's degradation state. Experimental results demonstrate a 99.6 % accuracy in completing the partial discharge voltage.

Since repetitive partial discharges (PDs) caused by anomalies in the insulation system lead to premature breakdowns of electrical machines, a reliable PD detection is of great importance. This paper proposes deep learning (DL) methods to improve the discrimination of PD from background noise in comparison with the state-of-the-art amplitude based PD detection in the production line. First, a systematic data extraction and labeling procedure is introduced to obtain correctly labeled datasets from arbitrary PD measurements. In addition, datasets are enhanced with low signal-to-noise ratio PD pulses by applying a special data augmentation approach. 13 different convolutional, recurrent and fully connected neural networks are compared for various time-frequency representations of the input signals. Hyperparameters for input transform, network topology and solver are optimized for all 13 combinations to ensure a fair case study. As a result, the two-dimensional convolutional neural network with continuous wavelet transform achieves the best accuracy of around 99.76% on a test dataset of PD signals originating from previously not utilized test objects. All DL models considered in this comparison outperform the state-of-the-art threshold-based PD classification. Even for PD events with an amplitude close to the noise level, the detection rate is still around 95% for the best network.

However, these CCs are susceptible to partial discharge (PD) activity, which can degrade insulation and lead to system failures. Detecting and analyzing PD are essential for maintaining power system reliability and safety. A key challenge in PD monitoring is transmitting the large volumes of PD signal data over unreliable 2G networks, as existing compression methods either compromise on data integrity or are ineffective. This paper introduces a novel lossy compression technique utilizing an autoencoder with skip connections and correction data to address this issue. Unlike previous algorithms that struggle with noisy time series data and fail to preserve crucial anomaly information, our method reconstructs the signal without anomalies, which are subsequently restored using correction data. Achieving a compression factor of about 25 (reducing data to 4.1% of its original size), this approach maintains essential PD signal features for analysis. The effectiveness of our method is validated by three classification algorithms, showing promise for future fault detection, diagnosis, and memory space reduction. This innovative compression solution marks a significant advancement in PD data processing, offering a balanced trade-off between compression efficiency and data fidelity, and paving the way for enhanced remote monitoring in power transmission systems. © 2024       "

Existing methods for diagnosing partial discharge (PD) insulation defects in gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) equipment can only be effective if there is sufficient labeled data. However, in the actual working conditions of GIS equipment, insulation defect data is very scarce, where labeled data is more expensive to obtain and most of the data is unlabeled. In the case of limited PD labeled data, it is still a serious challenge to achieve higher classification accuracy of GIS PD pattern recognition. Therefore, we propose a semi-supervised self-training algorithm based on density peaks of local neighbor Information. Firstly, an improved density peak clustering algorithm based on local neighbor information is proposed, which no longer depends on the truncation distance, and considers the local information to better reflect the local density. Secondly, using local neighbor Information of labeled data, the criterion of confidence of unlabeled data is improved. Then, the PD unlabeled data with pseudo-labels are used to build a strong classifier for GIS PD pattern recognition. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has higher classification accuracy than other semi-supervised algorithms. When the proportion of labeled data is 10 %, the recognition accuracy can reach 65.98 %, which is the highest in the comparison algorithm.

Such analysis facilitates the classification of these parameters into HS and low sensitive (LS) groups. Next, a deep learning (DL) model is developed for parameter identification, employing as minimal data as possible, specifically only partial discharge curves and their corresponding first-order derivatives, as inputs, while the electrochemical parameters are generated as outputs.

The existence of void amplifies the electric field stress caused by variations in the dielectric constant between air and the insulation that is all around it. PD activities on such XLPE insulation under high voltage stress are responsible for the growth of electrical- trees. Deep learning techniques have given opportunities for automated feature extraction and classification of the severity level of discharge activity during tree growth. In this work, the XLPE sample specimens are aged at different applied AC voltages, and the respective PD signals are continuously saved for every 500 cycles.

With the widely used cables in power systems, the accurate assessment of cable aging status is increasingly important. This study proposes an efficient assessment model based on the PSO-XGBoost algorithm, which integrates the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. The XGBoost model is established to assess the cable aging status with the inputs of partial discharge, operating life, corrosion condition and load condition. The PSO algorithm automatically optimizes parameters during XGBoost model training. Then, the standard performance evaluation metrics of the proposed assessment model are compared with four advanced classification models. The accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of the assessment model are above 98%, indicating that the proposed PSO-XGBoost model can accurately assess the cable aging state. Furthermore, these calculation results of the proposed model are better than the other four benchmark models, which shows that the proposed model performs better in cable aging status assessment than the existing models. © 2023       "

This paper proposes a wavelet transform and convolutional neural networks (WT-CNN) based classification model for the accurate and fast identification of corona disturbances in the partial discharge signals of cable termination for high-speed train. The method uses wavelet transform noise reduction and adaptive moment estimation (Adam) as the optimizer.

In this work, a simple-to-parameterise quantitative diagnostic approach is presented, which differentiates between loss of lithium inventory and loss of active materials in the anode and cathode. With an open-circuit voltage model and a genetic algorithm optimisation routine, peak signatures in voltage and capacity differentials are used to quantify degradation modes as opposed to traditional approaches of matching the whole voltage and capacity spectra. The outputs are validated with synthetic IC-DV spectra and achieve a low root-mean-square error of ± 2.0 %. A similar level of accuracy is achieved when heterogeneity is introduced in the synthetic degradation data and also with partial discharge data. Experiments from pouch cells under 5 C discharge and 0.3 C charge cycling at 25 °C and 45 °C, together with post-mortem measurements, confirm the accuracy of this approach with diagnosis scan taken at 0.3 C.

Fei, et al.",2023,A deep attention-assisted and memory-augmented temporal convolutional network based model for rapid lithium-ion battery remaining useful life predictions with limited data,10.1016/j.est.2023.106903,"Most of existing data-driven studies on lithium-ion battery remaining useful life (RUL) prediction consider a large scope of cyclic data over the entire battery life. Yet, applications of these models can be hindered due to restricted availability of such data in reality. This paper thus aims to study the battery RUL prediction from a new angle, predicting RUL via data collected from a limited number of incomplete cycles, i.e., 10 cycles, at any ageing stage. An advanced deep learning framework, the attention-assisted temporal convolutional memory-augmented network (ATCMN), is developed to realize an accurate and rapid battery RUL prediction under such challenging problem setting. To build an informative input based on limited data, a three-dimensional tensor input structure is first designed to integrate 10-cycle raw battery data including the time, capacity, and temperature dimensions obtained from the partial discharge process. To process such high dimensional input, the ATCMN first develops an attention module to automate weighting different battery parameters, time steps, and ageing cycles in the input. A temporal convolution module coordinating the dilated causal convolution and point-wise convolution is next developed to learn latent spatial-temporal feature representation from the weighted input. A memory-augmented module is further developed to enhance the latent feature representation through a reconstruction based on the historical information. Finally, the ATCMN employs a prediction module to derive nonlinear mappings from learned latent features to the battery RULs. A comprehensive computational study is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the ATCMN. Results report the higher accuracy and faster prediction of the ATCMN via benchmarking against a set of the state-of-the-art methods in the considered RUL predictions. Experimental results also show that the proposed ATCMN possesses better generalizability to different battery chemistries and operational conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd       "

Zhao, et al.",2023,Data-driven battery health prognosis with partial-discharge information,10.1016/j.est.2023.107151,"The unpredictability of battery degradation behavior is a challenging issue impeding the development of battery applications, due to the complexity of the degradation and the limitation of state measurement methods. Nowadays, with accessible battery aging datasets and machine learning algorithms, there are opportunities for data-driven battery health prognosis. However, most of the previous work is restricted in the scope of full-discharge capacity records extrapolation, which has insufficient prospects in real-life applications. In this work, we propose using partial discharge information for degradation estimation and prediction. Our Gaussian process regression model achieves good performance by limited partial discharge information without requirements of feature selection. The accurate battery health prognosis in 300 cycles can be carried out by one partial-discharge cycle at any degradation stage. The capacity estimation gives around 1 % root mean square error (RMSE) when using 30 % information on the discharge process. As full-cycle discharge is not required, the proposed model can diagnose the battery state of health (SOH) with a limited portion of battery operation information extracted during the discharge process and reduce the effort of capacity tests. Further development of this method brings opportunities for battery state evaluation and prediction in real applications with better applicability and accuracy. © 2023       "

The incidence of minor flaws and irregularities such as voids, surface imperfections, in the electrical insulation is however inevitable and lead to partial discharge (PD). Since each defect has a unique degradation mechanism, it is imperative to ascertain the correlation between the discharge patterns and the type of defect in order to evaluate the quality of the insulation. Efforts to correlate discharge patterns with the type of defects have been undertaken by several researchers. Though encouraging attempts to recognize and classify simple PD defect sources have been reported, misclassifications still occur, which affect the assessment of the index of the insulating degradation. A Composite Probabilistic Neural Network Inference System has been devised and elucidated in this research using two versions of Probabilistic Neural Network. The inference is obtained based on the outcome to innovatively conceived fourteen unique characteristic vector inputs to enable an accurate and reliable decision in the classification of complex stochastic PD patterns thus obviating the necessity of skilled operators.

Venkatesh, et al.",2011,Orthogonal least square center selection technique - A robust scheme for multiple source Partial Discharge pattern recognition using Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network,10.1016/j.eswa.2011.01.115,"Partial Discharge (PD) pattern recognition has emerged as a subject of vital interest for the diagnosis of complex insulation system of power equipment to personnel handling power system utilities and researchers alike, since the phenomenon serves inherently as an excellent non-intrusive testing technique. Recently, the focus of researchers has shifted to the recognition of defects in insulation due to multiple PD sources, as it is often encountered during real-time PD measurements. A survey of research literature indicates clearly that the recognition of fully overlapped PD patterns is yet an unresolved issue and that techniques such as Mixed Weibull Function, Neural Network (NN), Wavelet Transformation, etc. have been attempted with only reasonable success. Since most digital PD online acquisition systems record data for a stipulated and considerable duration as mandated by international standards, the database is large. This poses substantial complexity in classification during the training phase of the NNs. These difficulties may be attributed to ill-conditioned data, non-Markovian nature of discharges, curse of dimensionality of the data, etc. Since training methods based on random selection of centers from a large training set of fixed size are found to be relatively insensitive and detrimental to classification in many cases, a Forward Orthogonal Least Square algorithm (FOLS) is utilized in order to reduce the number of hidden layer neurons and obtain a parsimonious yet optimal set of centers. This algorithm, in addition, obviates the need for a separate clustering method making the procedure inherently viable for on-line PD recognition. This research work proposes a novel approach of utilizing Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN) with FOLS center selection algorithm for classification of multiple PD sources. Exhaustive analysis is carried out to ascertain the efficacy of classification of the proposed RBPNN-FOLS algorithm to cater to large training data set. A detailed comparison of the performance of the proposed scheme with that of the standard version of Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Heteroscedastic PNN (HRPNN) that was taken up for study by the authors in their previous work indicates firstly the effectiveness of FOLS algorithm in obtaining parsimonious centers, points out secondly the capability of the Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN) model to integrate the advantages of the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and PNN in classifying multiple PD sources and finally throws light on the exceptional capability of the FOLS-RBPNN in discriminating the sources of PD due to varying applied voltages also. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Of late, the focus of researchers has shifted to the identification and classification of multiple sources of PD since it is most often encountered in practical insulation systems of power apparatus. Researchers have carried out studies to recognize multi-source PD and expounded the difficulties experienced in discriminating such discharge patterns. It has also been observed that identification of such patterns becomes increasingly difficult with the degree of overlap. Review of recent research studies indicates that classification of fully overlapped patterns is yet an unresolved issue and that techniques such as Mixed Weibull Functions, neural networks (NN) and Wavelet Transformation have been attempted with reasonable degree of success for single source and partially overlapped PD patterns only. This research study focuses on extending the previous work attempted by the authors in utilizing the novel approach of Heteroscedastic Probabilistic Neural Network (HRPNN) for classification of single source PD patterns to that of multiple PD sources also. Further, a Robust Heteroscedastic Probabilistic Neural Network (RHRPNN) is implemented for the classification of multi-source PD patterns. The RHRPNN utilizes the jackknife procedure for handling problems associated with training the neural network due to the presence of outliers, thus providing a compact yet effective set of centers in terms of probability density functions. In addition to the previously utilized traditional statistical operators in the pre-processing phase, a Two Pass Split Window (TPSW) scheme has also been developed to study and compare the classification capability of the RHRPNN with that of HRPNN. Detailed analysis of the performance of RHRPNN is carried out to ascertain the influence of the smoothing parameter in classifying PD patterns, to determine the role played by the pre-processing techniques during classification and to find the significance of the parsimonious set of centers in eliminating the effect of outliers during classification. Finally, the ability of the HRPNN and the RHRPNN in classifying large dataset multiple source PD patterns obtained from varying applied voltages is analyzed for its further applicability in real-time PD pattern recognition studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These features achieve perfect classification rates (100%) for the EEG database from the University of Bonn. These classification rates outperform a number of existing EEG seizure detection methods published in the literature. However, it should be mentioned that several recent works also achieved this perfect classification rate (100%). Our proposed method should be as good as these works since our method only performs the DTCWT transform for up to 5 scales and our method only conducts the FFT to the 4th and 5th scales of the DTCWT decomposition. In addition, we could replace the conventional FFT in our method by sparse FFT so that our method could be even faster. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.       "

Robles, et al.",2016,Multiple partial discharge source discrimination with multiclass support vector machines,10.1016/j.eswa.2016.02.014,"The costs of decommissioning high-voltage equipment due to insulation breakdown are associated to the substitution of the asset and to the interruption of service. They can reach millions of dollars in new equipment purchases, fines and civil lawsuits, aggravated by the negative perception of the grid utility. Thus, condition based maintenance techniques are widely applied to have information about the status of the machine or power cable readily available. Partial discharge (PD) measurements are an important tool in the diagnosis of power systems equipment. The presence of PD can accelerate the local degradation of insulation systems and generate premature failures. Conventionally, PD classification is carried out using the phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) pattern of pulses. The PRPD is a two dimensional representation of pulses that enables visual inspection but lacks discriminative power in common scenarios found in industrial environments, such as many simultaneous PD sources and low magnitude events that can be hidden below noise. The literature shows several works that complement PRPD with machine learning detectors (neural networks and support vector machines) and with more sophisticated signal representations, like statistics captured in several modalities, wavelets and other transforms, etc. These methods improve the classification accuracy but obscure the interpretation of the results. In this paper, the use of a support vector machine (SVM) operating on the power spectrum density of signals is proposed to identify different pulses what could be used in an online tool in the maintenance decision-making of the utility. Particularly, the approach is based on an SVM endowed with a special kernel that operates in the frequency domain. The SVM is previously trained with pulses of different PD types (internal, surface and corona) and noise that are obtained with several test objects in the laboratory. The experimental results demonstrate that this technique is highly effective in identifying PD for cases where several sources are active or when the noise level is high. Thus, the early identification of critical events with this approach during normal operation of the equipment will help in the decision of decommissioning the asset with reduced costs and low impact to the grid reliability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In many applications, CP monitoring is performed in a reactive manner, e.g., variant treatment events are detected only after they have occurred in CPs. Alternatively, this article presents an intelligent learning system for predictive monitoring of CPs and from a large volume of electronic medical records (EMRs). Methods The proposed system is composed of both offline analysis and online monitoring phases. In the offline phase, a particular probabilistic topic model, i.e., treatment pattern model (TPM), is generated from electronic medical records to describe essential/critical medical behaviors of CPs. Using TPM-based measures as a descriptive vocabulary, online monitoring of CPs can be provided for ongoing patient-care journeys. Specifically, this article presents two typical predictive monitoring services, i.e., unusual treatment event prediction and clinical outcome prediction, to illustrate how the potential of the proposed system can be exploited to provide online monitoring services from both internal and external perspectives of CPs. Results The proposed monitoring services have been evaluated using a real clinical dataset pertaining to the unstable angina CP and collected from a large hospital in China. In terms of unusual treatment event prediction, the overall precision and recall of our system are 0.834, and 0.96, respectively, which is comparable to identify unusual treatment events in CPs in comparison with human evaluation. In terms of clinical outcome prediction, the stable model was characterized by 0.849 accuracy, 0.064 hamming-loss and 0.053 one-loss, which outperforms the benchmark multi-label classification algorithms on clinical outcome prediction. Conclusion Extensive evaluations on a real clinical data-set, typically missing from other work, demonstrate that the proposed system, as a crucial advantage over traditional expert systems for CP management, not only provides an efficient and general surveillance of CPs, but also empowers clinicians with the capability to look insights into CPs to gain a deeper understanding of the situations in which the proposed prediction technique performs well. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a hybrid fuzzy multiple (HFM)-SVM design with the convolution-base (which consists of a series of pooling and convolutional layers) and composite kernel function is proposed. The objective of the proposed classifier is to enhance the nonlinear fitting ability of the classifier and improve the classification performance in high-dimensional applications. The key points of the proposed HFM SVM are enumerated as follows: 1) The convolution-base of the proposed classifier extracts features. The extracted features exhibit flexibility and applicability in high-dimensional applications. 2) The proposed HFM SVM designed with the composite kernel could adjust the nonlinear fitting ability for improving classification performance. The procedure of the proposed HFM SVM is described as follows: Convolution-base is considered as a preprocessing unit for extracting features. The features are not always linearly separable especially when being extracted from high dimensional data. A composite kernel function is constructed by considering the complicated (nonlinear) classification boundary into several local linear boundaries. The structure of the extracted features is captured by FCM clustering and integrated into the composite kernel function for enhancing the nonlinear fitting ability of the proposed classifier. The nonlinearity of the composite function can fill the gap between linear and nonlinear kernel functions by adjusting the number of clusters obtained by the FCM clustering algorithm. The proposed HFM SVM classifier based on composite kernel could improve the classification performance on high dimensional datasets.

The inputs to the OGM(1,N) include the welding time, current, absolute difference in current at regular time intervals (5 s) and arc force. An optimum set of input parameters was identified by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE) for various parameter combinations for the most accurate weld bead height and depth prediction. The interaction of time, current, and arc force significantly affected the height and depth of weld beads. The predicted height and depth of weld beads using the time, current, and arc force showed RMSEs of 2.52 and 0.23, respectively, compared to experimental results.

The central task is to establish and experimentally test a formalism combining free radical polymerization kinetics with time dependent processes related to flows of material into and out of the reactor. Monomer feed experiments were performed that alternately hold molecular weight constant and ramp the weight up, in contrast to batch reactions, where molecular weight decreases. Three types of initiator feed 'tapers' were also used to produce predictable conversion kinetics and mass distributions: (i) constant initiator feed, (ii) linearly stepped feed to produce Gaussian conversion kinetics, and (iii) booster shots to produce multi-modal masses. Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization reactions (ACOMP) was used to follow the conversion and evolution of the average mass distribution, and multi-detector SEC was used to cross-check results and measure full distributions of endproducts.

Yang, et al.",2024,Rapid classification of coffee origin by combining mass spectrometry analysis of coffee aroma with deep learning,10.1016/j.foodchem.2024.138811,"Mislabeling the geographical origin of coffee is a prevalent form of fraud. In this study, a rapid, nondestructive, and high-throughput method combining mass spectrometry (MS) analysis and intelligence algorithms to classify coffee origin was developed. Specifically, volatile compounds in coffee aroma were detected using self-aspiration corona discharge ionization mass spectrometry (SACDI–MS), and the acquired MS data were processed using a customized deep learning algorithm to perform origin authentication automatically. To facilitate high-throughput analysis, an air curtain sampling device was designed and coupled with SACDI–MS to prevent volatile mixing and signal overlap. An accuracy of 99.78% was achieved in the classification of coffee samples from six origins at a throughput of 1 s per sample. The proposed approach may be effective in preventing coffee fraud owing to its straightforward operation, rapidity, and high accuracy and thus benefit consumers. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd       "

Borges, et al.",2015,Use of near infrared for evaluation of droplet size distribution and water content in water-in-crude oil emulsions in pressurized pipeline,10.1016/j.fuel.2015.01.053,"Droplet size distribution (DSD) and water content (WC) are two parameters that affect the type/intensity of treatment of water-in-crude oil (W/O) emulsions in the production fields. Besides, the crude oil viscosity and emulsion stability are strongly dependent of DSD and WC. Several papers have reported different techniques for evaluation of these properties; however, most of them were based on experiments performed at conditions of temperature and mainly pressure far from those found in the production fields. In this work, we demonstrate that optical microscopy and standard PLS models can be combined for calibration of a Near Infrared (NIR) spectrophotometer with regard to DSD of W/O emulsions with different water contents. Additionally, the NIR calibration models were validated considering the prediction of the DSD and WC of a distinct crude oil not used during the calibration step. Then, a new apparatus for online monitoring of W/O emulsions at pressures up to 30 bar is presented. The proposed apparatus employed both techniques (optical microscopy and near infrared spectroscopy) installed in series in the pressurized pipeline. The results indicate that the proposed apparatus is efficient for online monitoring of pressurized emulsions with water contents up to 17 wt% and average diameter (D(4,3)) from 6 to 40 μm. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

The concept of smart city has supported a higher quality of urban spaces and a better offering of public services. Smart grid is an important component and the energy supply of smart city. The health of the smart grid will directly affect the health of the smart city. Efficient and accurate prediction about icing level of transmission lines provides a reliable basis for anti-icing and deicing of power grids. The prediction can not only significantly enhance the reliability, safety and stability of transmission networks, but also timely provide the state monitoring of ice on wires to the workers to make proper decisions and to prevent freezing disasters so as to effectively protect people's safety and build a stable and friendly society. To reduce catastrophic damages caused by the iced transmission lines of the grid, this paper proposed a novel hybrid model called PR-KELM, an integration of Principal Component Analysis, ReliefF and Kernel based ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) method to predict the icing level of transmission lines. This hybrid model covered two stages including: 1) structured and unstructured data feature extraction by local binary patterns, principal component analysis and ReliefF; 2) radial basis function Kernel based ELM predicting the processed data. The experimental data adopted in this paper were from the online monitoring system of South China State Grid Online Monitoring System by terminal CC0289 between December 1, 2011 and March 1, 2016.

Raux, et al.",2011,Classification of worldwide drainage basins through the multivariate analysis of variables controlling their hydrosedimentary response,10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.12.005,"Quality and amount of waters and sediments conveyed within large drainage basins are crucial for human societies and biodiversity concerns. This work aims to determine the factors controlling the hydrosedimentary response (water discharge and sediment load) of 24 worldwide large drainage basins. In this respect, eleven geomorphologic and climatic variables routinely used in the literature were considered and others as fractal dimension, elongation and mean channel slope are novel for such an issue. In addition, two variables, land cover and lithology indexes, somewhat different from the literature in terms of calculation principles, were also included. All these variables were then subjected to multivariate statistical analyses (CA and PCA) and confronted in a matrix correlation. On the whole, our results display that water discharge is controlled by runoff, precipitation, basin area, elongation and fractal dimension while sediment load is governed by runoff, precipitation and maximum elevation. Mean channel slope and land-use have a minor role while other parameters (hypsometry, lithology, length, slope, mean elevation and temperature) do not play a significant role in the hydrosedimentary response. Such statistical analyses also bring out a classification of these drainage basins, comprising five to six main clusters which are ranged according to the main variables ruling their hydrosedimentary response. Two clusters are essentially governed by geomorphometric parameters (area, elongation, fractal dimension, mean elevation and hypsometry) while one cluster is rather controlled by transfer processes (runoff) and by active tectonic (maximum elevation). Hydrosedimentary response of arctic and continental rivers is controlled by low temperature while two drainage basins show any trend. A comparison of our results with other previous works dealing with this same issue points to some significant disagreements essentially based on the number of drainage basins considered, the number of nature of variables used and the analytical methods carried out. Despite their obvious influence, anthropogenic impacts are not considered in this study. In foreseeable works dealing with such issue, anthropogenic parameters would be required for a better description of hydrosedimentary responses of these large drainage basins. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The accurate ratios of the PD occurrence prediction using conventional observations of PD signals via oscilloscopes are improved by the proposed method. The standard PD pulse calibrator is installed and PD signals are individually injected into the power cable in each phase of three phase transmission lines. The electricity signal is simultaneously detected on the grounding line by the HFCTs. Furthermore, noises of measured signals are filtered by DWT for which a suitable mother function should be chosen. According to Kirchhoff's circuit law (KCL) and the concept of power delivery, the peak absolute value and average power of PD signal are applied as input of the PNN.

The consequences of insulation breakdown are well known. The trend is to move from conventional offline testing to online monitoring for insulation life prediction, which results in the inclusion of high frequency noise in the captured signals. Therefore de-noising is of paramount importance in online monitoring to obtain useful information from the signal. In this research, a 20 kV switchgear panel has been subjected to PD faults in the laboratory and measurements have been carried out by using different non-intrusive sensors including a novel sensor, the D-dot sensor and recorded by a high frequency oscilloscope. The measured results show the effective applicability of sensors for switchgear. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been used to de-noise PD signals in this paper.

The noise based on the oscilloscope's vertical resolution is a feature of the sampled signal that is always present when a digital acquisition system is used. In PD unconventional systems, several parameters such as the sampling frequency Fs, the acquisition time T, the number of samples N and the vertical resolution VR of the digitizer result in a wide oscilloscope-based noise variation, that could be quantified by the signal to noise ratio (snr). The classification map is a tool that came available with the development of unconventional systems, that due to their wide bandwidth are able to resolve PD pulses in time and apply clustering techniques for PD source separation. The equivalent time Teq and equivalent bandwidth Weq, used to plot the classification map, attempts to extract features of the PD pulses to form clusters so that classification of sources can be achieved. The classification map is based on the ability of separating PD sources by resorting to the parameters Teq and Weq, that are believed to show significant differences for distinct PD sources, while they are clearly consistent for the same source. This paper conducts a set of theoretical analysis and laboratory measurements to evaluate the influence of the oscilloscope-based noise on the results of Teq and Weq.

The first step in the proposed methodology is to prepare a set of classification features from the statistical moments of the distribution of the Wavelet detail coefficients extracted from a dataset of signals acquired from a test cell under 40 kVDC. In a second step, an unsupervised learning framework that implements the k–means algorithm is applied to reduce the dimensionality of this initial feature set. The Silhouette index is used to evaluate the number of natural clusters in the dataset while the Dunn index is used to determine which subset of features produces the best clustering quality. Since the unsupervised learning does not provide any method for result validation, then the third step in the methodology of this paper consists of applying a semi-supervised learning framework that implements Transductive Support-Vector Machines. The labeling of the test set that is required in this framework for the result validation is carried out by visual checking of the signal waveforms assisted by GUI tools such as the software PDflex. The results using this methodology showed a high classification accuracy and proved that both learning frameworks can be combined to optimize the selection of classification features. © 2020 The Authors       "

With increased interest in partial discharge (PD) testing with arbitrary waveforms and transients, these kind of data sets are becoming more and more common. Traditional clustering techniques cannot be applied due to big differences in spatial densities of the existing clusters in the data set. This paper contributes a simple yet efficient technique to recognize PD signals from noise and other disturbances. The signal recognition features are based on two specific areas extracted from the cumulative energy signal (CE) of each recorded waveform. These areas weigh up the extent to which the recorded signals have a pulse-like shape. A third feature, defined as a shape factor, extracts additional metrics from the CE signal that serves the purpose of accounting for the factors affecting the computation of the proposed recognition features and threshold for data size reduction. These three CE-based features are used to create a graph from which a real PD can be spotted in large impaired data sets.

All samples were examined under AC, positive DC, and negative DC electrical stresses, through which we captured thousands of PD pulses. We classify the waveforms of each PD type into representative groups associated to their discharge mechanisms. The statistical data of the measured pulses are utilized to identify the differences between AC and DC PDs while the clustered patterns of PD amplitude versus their temporal characteristics serve as a means to classify the types of PDs under AC and DC electrical stresses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd       "

The simulation is performed by solving the drift-diffusion-reaction equations for electrons, positive and negative ions. Spatial dependence and time evolution of the concentration of charged particles and created space electric field are used for detailed theoretical analysis of corona discharge based on the values of the transport and reaction gaseous coefficients. This exact drift-diffusion model enables clear physical picture of the corona discharge dynamics. It is used for the determination of the charge-voltage curves necessary for taking into account the corona effects in transient overvoltage calculation on transmission lines. In contrary to the previous engineering corona models, it is shown that the corona charge continues to increase although the input voltage pulse decreases after reaching its maximum value. This behavior is confirmed by measurements in a few experimental studies. Secondly, it has been shown that according to this model there are no positive streamers formation departing from central electrode or wire during decreasing edge of the input voltage pulse. The total charge simply commences to decrease when the negative ions neutralize themselves on the central electrode or wire of positive polarity. A sharp peak of corona current is observed immediately after the beginning of the intense ionization. The drift-diffusion model could also be used to check the validity of other common assumptions and predictions of previous engineering corona models. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd       "

The materials used in this work are UV videos captured by a UV camera. The algorithm is applied to the videos, which were captured during voltage application tests in five 230 kV polymeric insulators under different operational states. The algorithm is responsible for the image enhancement of the video frames and for the quantification and analysis of the extracted attributes. The video attributes are area, perimeter, form factor and persistence of the ultraviolet manifestation caused by corona discharges. The attributes are normalized and represented on radar charts. The results are presented for the application of an algorithm, developed for 230 kV polymeric insulators that were new, as well as those with corrosion defects, cracking, tracking and erosion with core exposure. Finally, the algorithm developed is an innovative tool that standardizes the data obtained from UV videos. In this case, during the application of the developed algorithm, it was possible to characterize the operational status of insulators with high manifestations of corona discharges, such as the polymeric insulators with tracking and erosion, with end fitting corrosion and with erosion and core exposure. For case with more moderate corona discharge manifestations, such as the polymeric insulator with cracking, there is no considerable UV manifestation, due to the operational status of the tested equipment.

However, the power transformers in service are subjected to various stresses like thermal stress and electrical stress, which may lead to several faults such as arching, partial discharge and overheating. In order to detect these incipient faults and ensure the normal operation of power transformers, the diagnostic methods based on Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) have been developed. However, the DGA methods suffer from low diagnostic accuracy. On the other hand, with the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a lot of intelligent algorithms have been applied in this area. However, most traditional AI algorithms are hard classification, which may cause the wrong diagnosis of faults. To overcome those disadvantages, a method based on the improved DS evidence theory and multiple probabilistic output algorithms is proposed in this paper to improve the performance of fault diagnosis of oil-immersed transformers. Firstly, the performance of the soft and hard classification algorithms is compared and analyzed. After that, three diagnostic models based on the Multiclass Relevance Vector Machine (MRVM), Multiclass Support Vector Machine (MSVM) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) are established. In order to improve the accuracy of these models, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimize their hyper-parameters. Finally, the combination of these three probabilistic output models is achieved based on the improved Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory, which can help to obtain a more accurate fault diagnosis result by fusing multiple algorithm results. The case study results show that the proposed method achieves a probabilistic output for the fault diagnosis of oil-immersed transformers and overcomes the deficiency of traditional DGA methods which are difficult to get accurate diagnosis results and can't summarize the fault development rule inductively. © 2021       "

However, the continuous changes of the key parameters that affect the cascading failure during the operation of the power system will affect the actual vulnerability of the lines. Especially with the increase in the penetration rate of renewable energy, the impact of frequent uncertainty and randomness brought by it can no longer be ignored. Therefore, the assessment results obtained from the static interaction graph cannot meet the accuracy requirements in the engineering, and also limit the scope of its application. How to realize the dynamization of the static interaction graph is the key to solving the above problems, which is also the difficulty that the current research has been facing. This paper proposes a construction method of multi-factor dynamic interaction graph based on generalized fault chains. With data-driven as the core, it realizes true dynamic and more accurate vulnerability assessment with the help of parallel distributed computing, uninterrupted data stream and sliding window. On this basis, according to the characteristics of generalized fault chains and the dynamic interaction graph, we propose and realize online monitoring for the classification of vulnerability lines for the first time.

An experimental work where an air flow in the shell side is humidified by a water flow in the tube side is performed to validate the model. It is found that the model predicts the flow distribution and the heat and mass transfer deteriorations well with local data for a triangular array. With the model, friction factor and Sherwood number deteriorations which take into account of the degree of irregularity, in terms of fractal dimension, are analyzed. The results show that the higher the packing density is, the less the fractal dimension is, and the less the non-uniformity of the flow distribution is.

Based on the “snapshots” method, the standard POD orthogonal basis is extracted from the high-fidelity data obtained from finite element analysis under various hot start load conditions to capture the main features of the stress fields. The complete stress field is reconstructed by the linear combination of the standard POD basis, and the modal coefficients are calculated using the discrete node stresses through the gappy POD procedure.

In this paper, we introduce a series of novel image classification algorithms based on CW-SSIM and use handwritten digit recognition, and face recognition as examples for demonstration. Among the proposed approaches, the best compromise between accuracy and complexity is obtained by the CW-SSIM support vector machine based algorithms, which combines an unsupervised clustering method to divide the training images into clusters with representative images and a supervised learning method based on support vector machines to maximize the classification accuracy. Our experiments show that such a conceptually simple image classification method, which does not involve any registration, intensity normalization or sophisticated feature extraction processes, and does not rely on any modeling of the image patterns or distortion processes, achieves competitive performance with reduced computational cost. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Y. S. Mayya, et al.",2004,Aerosol removal by unipolar ionization in indoor environments,10.1016/j.jaerosci.2004.03.001,"Corona discharge based unipolar ionizers are commonly used for reducing aerosol particle concentrations in indoor environments. The ions (usually negative) emitted from the ionizer help in charging the airborne particles, which are then removed from air space by electro-migration effects to the walls of the room due to the space charge induced electric fields. A system of equations has been formulated by considering various processes responsible for aerosol removal in the presence of the ionizers. These pertain to the space charge generated electric fields, particle charging, ion and particle removal rates under the combined action of diffusion, gravitational sedimentation, external ventilation and electric fields. The study includes steady-state situations corresponding to a continuous injection of particles as well as time dependent depletion of an initially injected aerosol. Model computations have been made to examine the dependence of the particle depletion characteristics and concentration reduction factors (CRFs) on particle sizes, concentrations and external ventilation rates. The ionizer induced concentration reduction factor is found to increase at higher particle concentrations. However, it is considerably reduced in the presence of even a small amount of external ventilation. The model predictions are found to compare favourably with the results of some of the experimental studies reported by earlier investigators as well as that carried out as a part of the present study. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"S. Box, et al.",2007,A multi-channel electrical mobility spectrometer with wedge geometry-Design and first evaluation,10.1016/j.jaerosci.2007.04.004,"This paper presents a new design for a multi-channel electrical mobility spectrometer which measures the lognormal size distribution and number concentration of aerosol particles in the size range 5-300 nm with a short response time. The spectrometer charges particles in the test sample by unipolar corona discharge, they are then classified into 16 channels by electrical mobility. Charged particles are detected in the channels by individual aerosol electrometers, giving an electrical mobility spectrum for the sample. The main aspect of the spectrometer design is a wedge-shaped classifier with flat electrodes. This allows a flow to be drawn from the classifier at 16 different levels/channels with minimal disturbance to the remaining flow, hence filter based aerosol electrometers can be used for detection. The varying field within the classifier caused by the wedge shape is advantageous to the classification and optimised through the selection of the wedge angle. Also presented is an alternative technique for inferring the lognormal size distribution of an aerosol from a measured electrical mobility spectrum. This involves using a theoretical model of the instrument to simulate the output mobility spectra for a large number of aerosol samples with lognormal size distributions. The resulting data library can be searched against a measured electrical mobility spectrum to find the corresponding size distribution. The experimental work presented in this paper is a first evaluation of this spectrometer and includes measurement of the classifier transfer functions, basic calibration of the charger, and finally testing the spectrometer's performance on some simple unimodal lognormal aerosol samples. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that predictions of the constant charging models are higher than that of the non-constant models but differ little for the sub-micrometer particles.

The experiments have shown that electronic charging of aerosols can be important in technical scale electrostatic precipitators (ESPs). Already at operation voltages just slightly above the corona onset voltage, the contribution of the free electrons to the overall current is estimated to be around 50 %. Due to the high temperature of free electrons, diffusion charging by free electrons allows to reach exceptionally high particle charge and extremely high precipitation efficiency. A strongly simplified theoretical model was developed, which gives a good prediction of particle charge based on averaged values of particle diameter, current density, electric field strength, electron temperature and residence time. The ion mobilities were determined by fitting the current-voltage characteristics with a modified Townsend (Monrolin et al. 2018) equation and are significantly higher than the values typically used to describe diffusion charging in air. This may be ascribed to the very dry gas phase and the short average lifespan of the ions under ESP conditions, which is in the order of 1 ms. From the practical point of view, electronic charging might be relevant in a number of technical applications, including high temperature ESPs, ESP applications in dry and oxygen-free gases and pulsed corona systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd       "

The latter accounts for the effect of film surface corrugations developed during the film drainage. For simplicity, the film surface mobility is neglected since the presence of surfactants reduces dramatically the film surface velocity [2]. The magnitude of surface non-homogeneities, caused by the film drainage, is accounted via a dynamic fractal dimension parameter α being spanned between zero and two. Depending on the α-value the film drains by different kinetic laws. For example, if the thin film is planar α=2 and it drains according to the Reynolds law [3]; if α=1 the film contains an axisymmetric dimple causing faster drainage; if α=1/2 the film exhibits number of asymmetric dimples [4] and the film drains even faster; finally if α=0 the film contains spatially uncorrelated domains causing the fastest possible drainage. The present analysis of experimental data suggests that the parameter α is inversely proportional to the film radius R and it is independent of the type and concentration of surfactants. A semi-empirical model for α is proposed, thus completing the generic dynamic fractal classification. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.       "
K. Li,2010,More general capillary pressure and relative permeability models from fractal geometry,10.1016/j.jconhyd.2009.10.005,More general capillary pressure and relative permeability models were derived theoretically from fractal modeling of a porous medium. It was found that the new capillary pressure model could be reduced to the frequently-used Brooks-Corey capillary pressure model and the Li-Horne imbibition model when the fractal dimension of a porous medium takes specific values. This also demonstrates that the Brooks-Corey model and the Li-Horne model have a further confirmed theoretical basis. Capillary pressure data measured using mercury intrusion techinque were used to verify the model. The results demonstrated that the new capillary pressure model could represent the capillary pressure curves in those rocks with fracures or with great heterogeneity while the existing models cannot. The new relative permeability models can be reduced to the Brooks-Corey relative permeability model in a specific case. It has been proved theoretically that the relative permeability of each phase in a smooth fracture is only a linear function of its own saturation. Relative permeability data were calculated using the new models and the model results were compared with experimental data measured using a steady-state technique. The comparison demonstrated that the relative permeability models and experimental results were consistent with each other. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.       
"N. Monrolin, et al.",2021,Multi-scale two-domain numerical modeling of stationary positive DC corona discharge/drift-region coupling,10.1016/j.jcp.2021.110517,"Corona discharge modeling mostly relies on two, mostly distinct, approaches: high-fidelity, numerically challenging, unsteady simulations having high-computational cost or low-fidelity simulations based on empirical assumptions such as constant electric field at the emitter electrode. For the purpose of steady discharge current predictions, high-fidelity models are very costly to use whilst empirical models have limited range of validity owing the subtle use of tuned parameters. We propose an intermediate approach: an asymptotic multi-scale/two-domain numerical modeling based upon generalizing previous asymptotic axi-symmetrical analysis [1,2]. We show how the initial elliptic (electric potential), hyperbolic (charge transport), non-local (photo-ionization) problem can be formulated into two local problems coupled by matching conditions. The approach relies on a multipole expansion of the radiative photo-ionization source term (in two dimensions for cylindrical emitters). The analytical asymptotic matching conditions derived in [2] result in flux continuity conditions at the boundary of the two domains. These coupling conditions are enforced by Lagrange multipliers, within a variational formulation, leading to a hierarchy of non-linear coupled problems. The proposed approach is both monolithic and two-domains: two asymptotic regions, an inner-one associated with corona discharge, and an outer-one, the ion drift region. Numerical convergence and validations of the finite element implementation is provided. A comparison with various experimental results convincingly demonstrate the applicability of the method, which avoids tuning parameters dedicated to each specific configuration, but, on the contrary, exclusively relies on known and measurable physical quantities (e.g., ion mobilities, photo-ionization coefficient, ionization electric field, Townsend discharge coefficient, etc…). © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the simulation of this category of plasma plays an increasingly important role since more and more complex, and technically relevant, configurations can be represented. Various kinds of models have been considered, one possible classification is relative to the way the electronic energy is computed. In the local electric field approximation a simple algebraic relationship is used which directly links the electric field strength to the electron energy. On the contrary, in the local mean energy approximation a proper differential equation is solved. In most cases this equation is coupled with a conservation equation which predicts the electron concentration. We will tackle this latter case and we will introduce a formulation capable of decoupling the electron density equation from the electron energy one. We will study the properties of the new formulation and we will build a proper numerical scheme capable of preserving, at a discrete level, these properties. Moreover, we will also discuss the existence of the discrete solution and test the performances of the scheme both in simple test cases, where an exact solution is known, and in a technically relevant configuration such as the formation of a treeing structure. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

F.

The original capability of BFLOC is to couple turbulence-induced flocculation of suspended minerals and micro-organisms with the nutrient-related dynamics of aggregate-attached micro-organisms. The model, calibrated and validated against the average floc size recorded at two stations in the Belgian North Sea [Fettweis, M., Francken, F., Pison V., Ven den Eynde, D., 2006. Suspended particulate matter dynamics and aggregate sizes in a high turbidity area. Marine Geology 235, 63-74], closely captured site conditions and significantly clarified interpretation of field measurements. Modeling results indicated that an accurate prediction of time-varying floc sizes was possible only by taking into account the organic fraction of the suspended particle matter and the micro-organism colonization of the floc micro-environment. BFLOC showed that the floc excess density strongly correlated with the floc biomass volume, while the settling velocity strongly correlated with the floc mineral volume. We noticed that the settling velocity was poorly correlated with the total floc volume (and floc size), suggesting a revision of current methods that assess suspended matter deposition uniquely on the basis of the floc size. Additionally, various hypotheses tested with BFLOC suggested that the effect of aggregate-attached biomass on aggregation and breakup rates was very small when it was accounted for with a first-order description. More generally, the sediment and biomass parameters found here were nearly site independent suggesting that the mechanistic approach of BFLOC was relatively robust. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The fractal dimension of soil aggregates has been related to their size distributions and stabilities. Several fractal models have been proposed for estimating fractal dimension of soil aggregates. This study was conducted to investigate how closely the soil interrill erodibility factor in WEPP model can be correlated to and predicted from soil aggregate size distribution or from their fractal dimensions. Samples from 36 soil series with contrasting properties were collected from northwest of Iran. The fractal dimensions of soil aggregates were calculated from Rieu and Sposito (Dn), Tyler and Wheatcraft (DmT), and Young and Crawford (DmY) models using aggregate size distribution (ASD) data. A rainfall simulator with drainable tilting flume (1×0.5m) at slope of 9% was employed and total interrill erosion (TIE), total splashed soil (TS) and interrill erodibility factor (Ki) were calculated for 20, 37, and 47mmh-1 rainfall intensities. Results showed that both Dn and DmT estimated from aggregate wet-sieving data characterized ASD of the examined soils and significantly (p<0.01) correlated to TS, TIE and Ki. Values of Dn and DmT estimated from dry-sieving data only correlated to TS but not to TIE and Ki. Using air-dried aggregates of 4.75-8mm size range, instead of aggregates <4.75mm, in wet-sieving was better for estimating Dn as an index for the predication of TIE, TS and Ki. Correction of ASD for the particle fraction greater than lower sieve mesh size in each size class decreased the correlation coefficient between TIE, TS or Ki and Dn or DmT. The values of DmY were not correlated to TS, TIE and Ki. The correlation coefficient TIE and Ki with Dn and DmT derived from wet-sieving data, were higher than those with wet-aggregate stability (WAS), mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD), implying that Dn and DmT may be better alternative variables for empirically predicting soil erodibility factor and hence interrill erosion. © 2011.

However, there is still a lack of research on online monitoring of resistance upset butt welding. This study proposes to collect the state information in the welding process and combine with the unsupervised learning method to predict the final welding quality. The collected state information includes the dynamic resistance curve, electrode displacement curve, and upset pressure curve. And state information of 308,274 welding joints was collected. Because of the high production frequency of chains, it is difficult to obtain the quality label by the destructive detection method. The commonly used supervised learning is no longer applicable. In view of this challenge, the unsupervised learning methods, Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor are proposed to predict the welding quality online for the first time. Another critical problem is that the unsupervised learning model lacks evaluation criteria. This paper presented the concept of separation degree between anomalous data set and normal data set to solve this problem. The classification performance of the model is judged by comparing the separation degree. According to the separation degree calculation results, the Isolation Forest's classification performance is better than the Local Outlier Factor. Finally, according to the classification results of Isolation Forest, the correlation between state information and welding quality is analyzed. It is found that the upset pressure and dynamic resistance can reflect the change of welding quality, but the correlation between electrode displacement and welding quality is not significant. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers       "

Guided by this difficulty, an online monitoring method of the grinding surface roughness based on Improved Fireworks Algorithm (IFWA) was proposed. According to the frequency spectrum analysis of grinding force signal and surface texture curve, and with the help of chi-square distribution density function, the functional relationship between grinding force signal and surface texture amplitude-frequency curve was established. Then, the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) of the aforementioned mathematical function was executed to procure the mathematical relationship of the grinding force signal expressing the surface texture curve. Furthermore, the least square method was used to calibrate the profile least-square median of the surface texture curve. The calculation process of the surface texture curve to the surface roughness was then incorporated into the IFWA. Eventually, the elite retention strategy was introduced into the standard Fireworks Algorithm (FWA). An IFWA was designed to optimize the attenuation coefficient in the grinding force signal and surface texture curve function model. Taking the plane grinding of silica ceramic composites as an example, a theoretical model for online monitoring the grinding surface roughness was established based on the experimental data, and the prediction results in the accuracy of the method was the highest by comparing various algorithms.

Developing a real-time monitoring technology to guide the production process of parts can solve this problem. Currently, the quality of L-PBF with different scanning strategies varies greatly. Therefore, the online monitoring methods for a specific scanning strategy cannot be effectively generalized to other scanning strategies. This is a rarely investigated topic in L-PBF, and defects monitoring mechanism research is insufficient to effectively support the study of L-PBF defects monitoring technology utilizing advanced sensing technologies. Towards this end, we explored the acoustic source generation mechanism, analyzed the acoustic monitoring principle of L-PBF defects, and hence, we propose a novel online monitoring method for L-PBF defects based on air-borne acoustic emission (ABAE) and deep transfer learning (DTL). The method uses time-frequency spectrograms of acoustic signals as the input to the network, and a method of deep transfer learning with multi-source domains knowledge fusion (DTL-MDKF) is proposed to realize the classification of defects. The proposed method was compared with the traditional transfer learning method based on single-source domain knowledge. The results showed that the classification accuracy of the proposed method for L-PBF defects is 98.2 %. In addition, the feature mining capability of the DTL-MDKF is demonstrated by visualizing the features of transfer learning models with different knowledge.

While UMW has numerous important advantages compared to traditional fusion-based welding methods, its performance can be substantially influenced by process anomalies such as tool degradation and material surface contamination, which are commonly encountered in industrial-scale productions. Recently, online monitoring has demonstrated excellent anomaly detection capabilities. However, the existing monitoring algorithms require a large amount of labeled data and lack the generalizability or adaptability to new process configurations (i.e., domains). This paper develops a meta-learning-based explainable few-shot learning (XFSL) framework that enables highly data-efficient adaptation of online monitoring algorithms to new process configurations with excellent explainability. We consider two distinct types of problems including tool condition monitoring and workpiece surface condition classification with varying UMW configurations. Using experimental data, we demonstrate that the proposed XFSL method achieves high classification performance in previously unseen target domains and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, XFSL is able to evaluate the importance of each feature, thus revealing key features, feature types, and signal frequencies. It is shown that explainability-based feature selection can effectively eliminate unimportant information from monitoring signals while maintaining and even improving prediction performance. The proposed XFSL method is extensible to other manufacturing applications and holds significant potential for advancing the generalizability, adaptability, and agility of decision-making algorithms in modern manufacturing. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers       "

Monopolar electrosurgery compared with other energy sources is associated with unique characteristics and inherent risks and complications caused by inadvertent direct or capacitive coupling or insulation failure of instruments. These dangers become particularly important with the reemergence of single-port laparoscopy, which requires close proximity and crossing of multiple intraabdominal instruments outside the surgeon's field of view. Study Objectives: To determine the effects of monopolar electrosurgery on various tissues/organs during simulated single-port laparoscopic surgery in vitro and in vivo. Design: Simulation in a dry laboratory with fresh sheep liver, pig bowel and bowel in an anesthetized dog (Canadian Classification II-3). Setting: University-affiliated teaching hospital and animal facilities. Measurements and Main Results: We used Valleylab Force 2 and FX electrosurgical generators at clinically used power outputs of 40 to 60 watts, and both high- and low-voltage (coagulation and cut) waveforms and commercially-available single-port devices. The effect on tissue was recorded by pictures and video camera and graded visually and histologically with hematoxylin and eosin stains. During activation of any standard monopolar laparoscopic instrument (scissors, coagulating electrode, etc), capacitive coupled currents resulting in visible tissue burn (blanching) caused by other adjacent cold instrument (graspers, etc) including metallic suction-irrigation cannulas and the laparoscope itself were noted. Histopathologic study confirmed transmural thermal damage extending to the mucosa of small bowel, even in the presence of mild serosa blanching. With prolonged activation of the electrosurgical generator, the capacitive coupled corona discharge burned the insulation and caused rapid insulation breakdown of the electrode instrument resulting in direct coupling (sparking, arcing) to adjacent cold instruments and more severe burning to the contacted tissue/organ. Conclusions: During single-port laparoscopy and use of monopolar radiofrequency, the proximity and crossing of multiple instruments generate capacitive or direct coupled currents, which may cause visceral burns. © 2011 AAGL.

Currently, accurate monitoring of local defects in the laser AM process remains a challenge. This paper proposes a method for predicting local defects in the laser AM process based on a dynamic mapping strategy and the multibranch fusion convolutional neural network (MBFCNN). In-situ sensing of the laser-material interaction zone is achieved using a camera integrated coaxially with the printing system. Experiment-based datasets are constructed, in which the in-process images were sampled and matched to the extracted local defect information based on their temporal-spatial correspondence. A dynamic mapping strategy using a sliding sampling window is introduced to achieve continuous monitoring. Considering the cyclic and layer-by-layer processing principle of laser AM, we propose MBFCNN to map the in-process images to local defect information.

Shi, et al.",2010,Fractal model for predicting the effective binary oxygen diffusivity of the gas diffusion layer in proton exchange membrane fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.080,"We propose an analytical model to predict the effective binary oxygen diffusivity of the porous gas diffusion layer (GDL) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this study, we consider the fractal characteristics of the porous GDL as well as its general microstructure, and we adopt the Bosanquet equation to derive effective diffusivity. The fractal characterization of GDL enables us to model effective diffusivity in a continuous manner while taking into account the effect of pore size distribution. Comparison to two other theoretical models that are generally accepted in the simulation of PEMFCs shows similar trends in all three models, indicating that our proposed model is well founded. Furthermore, the predicted effective binary oxygen diffusivities of two samples show that after treatment with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the effective binary diffusivity of the GDL decreases. Based on the parametric effect analysis, we conclude that effective binary diffusivity is negatively correlated with tortuosity fractal dimension but positively correlated with the fractal dimension of pore area, porosity, or mean pore diameter. The proposed model facilitates fast prediction of effective diffusivity as well as multi-scale modeling of PEMFCs and thus facilitates the design of the GDLs and of PEMFCs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, corresponding sub-models based on the mechanism model and industrial data are first established. Then, the two linear forms of them are combined to arrive at the mechanism- and data-driven hybrid variable weighted stacked autoencoder random forest (M-HVW-SAE-RF) soft sensing model. Among them, the stacked autoencoder (SAE) network is utilized to extract the deep features of the data, and the random forest (RF) is employed to realize the regression prediction of the target variable. Secondly, for the problem of model uncertainty, based on the identification for control (I4C) theory, a performance-driven hierarchical control strategy is established on the basis of the model predictive control-adaptive disturbance rejection control (MPC-ADRC). The main goal is to achieve the best output performance of the actual control system and to implement online monitoring of crystal size and V/G.

The surface undulations altering vehicle ride over homogeneous areas are defined, by the US Army, as a single number descriptor entitled root-mean-square (RMS). A current need exists to attribute large geographic areas with RMS values in order to better support vehicle speed predictions with remotely sensed data. The RMS is typically computed using centimeter scale data, which can be difficult and time consuming to collect. A technique to extrapolate RMS for large areas was developed based on meter-scale data to predict RMS using a combination of fractal dimension and spectral analysis. Validation of the extrapolation technique was based on 43 vehicle ride courses with 30-cm data. For each ride course, a two dimensional fractal dimension (FD) was computed using the divider method, and a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) was used to compute the power spectral density (PSD). A regression analysis was performed to search for correlations between RMS, FD, and PSD given fixed-slope power law fit parameters. Using a stepwise model selection, a statistical model for rapid predictions of RMS was developed. The RMS was computed from FD and the PSD DC offset to within 80% agreement using a linear model. © 2011 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.       "

Wang, et al.",2024,Token singularity understanding and removal for transformers,10.1016/j.knosys.2024.111718,"This work delves into unveiling the singularity issue latent in global attention-based Transformers. Empirical and theoretical analyses elucidate that interrelationships among token channels lead to singularities, impeding the training of attention weights. Concretely, the similar neighbor pixels within image patches can form intercorrelated channels after being flattened. Images that one color dominates can possess correlated channels. Furthermore, the fixed global connection architecture retains correlation relationships, contributing to the persistence of singularities. High singularity risks reducing Transformers’ performance and robustness. Based on the singularity analysis, we propose the Token Singularity Removal (TSR) strategy. It incorporates the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) stem and Feature Decorrelation (FD) loss, aiming to encourage Transformers to learn tokens with unrelated channels and eliminate singularities.

When tested using clean PD data, most machine learning models can easily achieve above 90% accuracy. However, when tested using PD data overlapped with noise, classification accuracy reduces significantly. In this work, the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based PD classification system using transfer learning was proposed. In order to achieve a more practical performance evaluation, a modified 10-fold cross-validation procedure was used where the CNN-based PD classifier was trained using clean PD data but tested using PD data that has been overlapped by noise.

This paper introduces an innovative algorithm for classifying the criticality of insulation based on attributes extracted from videos recorded using an ultraviolet detection camera. The attributes extracted from each facula origin include maximum persistence, area, and the minimum distance between the facula origin and the insulation. To obtain this distance, a technique combining a deep convolutional neural network model with an adaptive segmentation thresholding method is proposed. To validate the proposed methodology, inspections were conducted at a 500 kV substation. A total of 96 videos were recorded, within which 99 facula origins were identified.

Wavelet transforms were already often and successfully applied to the classification of colonic polyps, whereas curvelets, contourlets and shearlets have not been used for this purpose so far.We apply different feature extraction techniques to extract the information of the subbands of the wavelet based methods. Most of the in total 25 approaches were already published in different texture classification contexts. Thus, the aim is also to assess and compare their classification performance using a common framework. Three of the 25 approaches are novel. These three approaches extract Weibull features from the subbands of curvelets, contourlets and shearlets. Additionally, 5 state-of-the-art non wavelet based methods are applied to our databases so that we can compare their results with those of the wavelet based methods.It turned out that extracting Weibull distribution parameters from the subband coefficients generally leads to high classification results, especially for the dual-tree complex wavelet transform, the Gabor wavelet transform and the Shearlet transform. These three wavelet based transforms in combination with Weibull features even outperform the state-of-the-art methods on most of the databases. We will also show that the Weibull distribution is better suited to model the subband coefficient distribution than other commonly used probability distributions like the Gaussian distribution and the generalized Gaussian distribution.So this work gives a reasonable summary of wavelet based methods for colonic polyp classification and the huge amount of endoscopic polyp databases used for our experiments assures a high significance of the achieved results. © 2016 The Authors.

In general, poorly differentiated tumours are characterized by a higher degree of architectural irregularity and complexity of histological structures. Fractal dimension is a useful parameter for characterizing complex irregular structures. However, one of the difficulties of estimating the fractal dimension from microscopic images is the segmentation of pathologically relevant structures for analysis. A commonly used technique to segment structures of interest is to apply a pixel intensity threshold to convert the original image to binary and extract pixel outline structures from the binary representation. The difficulty with this approach is that the value of the threshold required to segment the histological structures is highly dependent on the staining technique chosen and imaging conditions (i.e., illumination time, intensity, and uniformity) of the microscopic system. In this work, we present a method for finding the optimal intensity threshold by maximizing the corresponding fractal dimension. This method results in the segmentation of histological structures and the estimation of their fractal dimension (independent of imaging conditions). We applied our technique to 164 prostate histology sections from 82 prostate core biopsy specimens (two serial sections from each of the 63 benign prostate tissues and 19 high grade prostate carcinoma). We stained one of the serial sections with conventional hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) and the other with pan-keratin, and found that the difference in mean fractal dimension between the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.0001) for both stains. However, using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, we conclude that our fractal dimension method applied to the images of pan-keratin stained sections provides greater classification performance (benign versus high grade) than with those stained with H&E when compared to the original histological diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity achieved with the pan-keratin images were 89.5% and 90.5%, respectively. Crown Copyright © 2008.       "

Sun, et al.",2018,Investigation of artificial neural network algorithm based IGBT online condition monitoring,10.1016/j.microrel.2018.07.068,"Reliability of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) has drawn much attention in recent years. Online monitoring of IGBT is an effective mehod to improve IGBT operation reliability. State-of-the-art online monitoring methods for IGBT are based on thermal sensitive electrical parameters (TSEPs) extraction, but the TSEPs can be hardly obtained with required accuracy in practical application. This paper investigates Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based IGBT online monitoring method. DC link voltage and H-bridge output voltage, which are practical measurable parameters, are selected as the input of ANN. Both single input single output (SISO) and multiple input single output (MISO) neural networks are analysed and discussed. With the proposed method, the relationship of the practical measurable parameters and investigated TSEP, on-resistance of IGBT, can be established. By applying the existing criterion of TSEPs for the IGBT reliability, the prediction of the IGBT failure can be achieved. Simulations verify that the errors brought by the established model are within precision requirements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd       "

However, the influence of harmonics and degradation process on MFC are not well described by the conventional lifetime prediction method, causing a large gap between prediction result and engineering practice. Therefore, this paper further explores the aging failure mechanisms of MFC and proposes an improved lifetime prediction method. The function mechanism that the harmonics change the partial discharge inside MFC to affect lifetime is expounded, which is modelled by several influence factors. Moreover, the coupling relationship of hot-spot temperature and equivalent series resistor (ESR) aging is discussed by an improved aging model based on the parameter drift of ESR.

Recent research findings show that application of nanoparticles in dielectric liquids may increase their resistance to partial discharges. However, physical properties of a host liquid are expected to play a decisive role in the effective suppression of partial discharges by nanoparticles. In this paper, a transformer oil prepared by a gas-to-liquid technology and a standard naphthenic transformer oil are doped with an equal amount of iron oxide nanoparticles. Determination of basic physical properties of the oils and the nanofluids is followed by an experimental investigation of partial discharges under various alternating voltage levels. The detection of partial discharges is approached by two independent methods, electrically and acoustically. Both methods revealed occurrence of partial discharges in the gas-to-liquid oil at higher voltages, as compared with the naphthenic oil. Acoustic emission energy is found one order of magnitude greater in the gas-to-liquid oil than in the naphthenic oil. The acoustic wave propagation dependence on the physical properties of the liquid is considered in the qualitative explanation of the observed phenomenon. The presence of nanoparticles can suppress partial discharges in the naphthenic oil, but not in the gas-to-liquid oil. © 2021 The Author(s)       "

The experimental results were confirmed with the use of theoretical method, based on density functional theory. Two peaks were observed in the ion mobility spectrum in the positive ion mode which was corresponded to the protonated isomers of para-aminophenol. It was observed that the relative intensities of the peaks depend on the sample concentration and the nature of the reactant ions. The relative energies of ions derived from protonation of para-aminophenol and its topical proton affinities were determined for different sites in the gas phase. The peak with the lower drift time was assigned to the oxygen protonated isomer and the other peak was ascribed to the nitrogen protonated isomer of para-aminophenol. The calculated dipole moment and localized charge of each isomer were used to verify the ion mobility peak separation. It was shown that combination of theoretical and experimental tools leads to reliable prediction of reactive protonation sites of chemicals in a corona discharge. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In non-stationary environments, the classifier must be able to adjust its parameters according to changes in the environment conditions. This requires a continuous learning while new patterns are available. Incremental learning is an efficient continuous learning technique for updating the classifier parameters without starting from scratch every time a new pattern is available. However in non-stationary environments, data characteristics may drift over time. This leads to deteriorate dramatically the performance of incremental learning algorithms over time. This is due to the use of data which is no more consistent with the characteristics of new incoming data. Thus, a mechanism to use only the recent and representative patterns to update the classifier parameters without a ""catastrophic forgetting"" is necessary. In this paper, we propose a dynamic pattern recognition method, named Dynamic Fuzzy Pattern Matching, to be used for the online monitoring of non-stationary processes functioning. This method is based on the use of an incremental algorithm allowing to follow the accumulated gradual changes of classes characteristics after the classification of each new pattern. When the accumulated gradual changes reach a suitable predefined threshold, the classifier parameters are adapted online using the recent and useful patterns. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.       "

This simple codification mechanism is similar to the one found in various known neuronal circuits, which renders these animals as good models for the study of natural communication systems, allowing experiments involving behavioral and neuroethological aspects. Performing analysis of data collected from more than one freely swimming fish is a challenge since the detected electric organ discharge (EOD) patterns are dependent on each animal's position and orientation relative to the electrodes. However, since each fish emits a characteristic EOD waveform, computational tools can be employed to match each EOD to the respective fish. In this paper we describe a computational method able to recognize fish EODs from dyads using normalized feature vectors obtained by applying Fourier and dual-tree complex wavelet packet transforms. We employ support vector machines as classifiers, and a continuity constraint algorithm allows us to solve issues caused by overlapping EODs and signal saturation.

For this task, this paper proposes a novel intelligent method based on dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform (DTCWPT) and multiple classifier fusion. In this method, in order to effectively extract underlying fault characteristic information, DTCWPT, which enjoys such attractive properties as nearly shift-invariance and reduced aliasing, is introduced and performed on vibration signals, and then an original feature set including time-domain and frequency-domain features is extracted from the frequency-band signals of DTCWPT to reveal machine conditions. In order to achieve the desired performance of fault classification, a new framework for multiple classifier fusion is developed on the basis of neighborhood rough set (NRS). The original feature set is firstly granulated into different granularity levels by NRS and different sensitive feature sets (SFSs) are obtained for reflecting the machine conditions from different perspectives. After that, the SFSs are respectively input into different classification algorithms to achieve the complementary advantages and substantive fusion of different classifiers. Finally, the classification results of multiple classifiers based on different classification algorithms and input SFSs are fused using Bayesian belief method to come up with the final diagnosis result. The proposed method is applied to the fault diagnosis of gearbox and locomotive roller bearings. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method is able to reliably identify the different fault categories which include both single fault and compound faults, which has a better classification performance compared to any one of the individual classifiers. Moreover, the validity of feature selection based on NRS and the superiority of feature extraction based on DTCWPT are also demonstrated by the testing results. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.       "

The image fusion process was formulated as a two-class classification problem: in and out-of-focus classes.

A bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA) was developed to obtain the optimal parameters of the SVM. The output of the classification system was used as a decision matrix for fusing high-frequency wavelet coefficients from multi-focus source images in different directions and decomposition levels of the DT-CWT. After the high and low-frequency coefficients of the source images were fused, the final fused image was obtained using the inverse DT-CWT.

This study aims at improving the accuracy of automated mitosis detection by characterizing mitotic cells in wavelet based multi-resolution representations via a non-Gaussian modeling method. The potential mitosis candidates were decomposed into multi-scale forms by an undecimated dual-tree complex wavelet transform. Two non-Gaussian models (the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) and the symmetric alpha-stable (SαS) distributions) were used to accurately model the heavy-tailed behavior of wavelet marginal distributions. The method was evaluated on two independent data cohorts, including the benchmark dataset (MITOS), via a support vector machine classifier. The quantitative results shows that the bivariate SαS model achieved superior classification performance with the area under the curve value of 0.82 in comparison with 0.79 for bivariate GGD, 0.77 for univariate SαS, 0.72 for univariate GGD, and 0.59 for Gaussian model. Since both mitotic and non-mitotic cells appear as small objects with a large variety of shapes, characterization of mitosis is a hard problem. The inter-scale dependencies of wavelet coefficients allowing extraction of salient features within the cells that are more likely to appear at all different scales were captured by the bivariate non-Gaussian models, leading to more accurate detection results. The presented automated mitosis detection method might assist pathologists in enhancing the operational efficiency and productivity as well as improving diagnostic confidence. © 2017       "

The model frames the problem of strength recovery as that of learning appropriate activations of residual corticospinal neurons to their target motoneuronal pools. For example, for an agonist/antagonist muscle pair, we assume the motor system must learn to activate preserved agonist-exciting corticospinal neurons and deactivate preserved antagonist-exciting corticospinal neurons. The model incorporates a biologically plausible reinforcement learning algorithm for adjusting cell activation patterns-stochastic search-using generated limb force as the teaching signal to adjust the synaptic weights that determine cell activations. The model makes predictions consistent with clinical and brain imaging data, such as that patients can achieve an increase in strength after appearing to reach a recovery plateau (i.e.,""residual capacity""), that the differential effect of a dose of movement practice will be greater earlier in recovery, and that force-related brain activation will increase in secondary motor areas following a stroke. An interesting prediction that could be explored clinically is that temporarily inhibiting subpopulations of more powerfully connected corticospinal neurons during late movement training will allow the motor system to optimize corticospinal neurons with a weaker influence, whose optimization was blocked by the rapid optimization of more strongly connected neurons early in training. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Strauss, et al.",2015,Choice reaching with a LEGO arm robot (CoRLEGO): The motor system guides visual attention to movement-relevant information,10.1016/j.neunet.2015.10.005,"We present an extension of a neurobiologically inspired robotics model, termed CoRLEGO (Choice reaching with a LEGO arm robot). CoRLEGO models experimental evidence from choice reaching tasks (CRT). In a CRT participants are asked to rapidly reach and touch an item presented on the screen. These experiments show that non-target items can divert the reaching movement away from the ideal trajectory to the target item. This is seen as evidence attentional selection of reaching targets can leak into the motor system. Using competitive target selection and topological representations of motor parameters (dynamic neural fields) CoRLEGO is able to mimic this leakage effect. Furthermore if the reaching target is determined by its colour oddity (i.e. a green square among red squares or vice versa), the reaching trajectories become straighter with repetitions of the target colour (colour streaks). This colour priming effect can also be modelled with CoRLEGO. The paper also presents an extension of CoRLEGO. This extension mimics findings that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the motor cortex modulates the colour priming effect (Woodgate et al., 2015). The results with the new CoRLEGO suggest that feedback connections from the motor system to the brain's attentional system (parietal cortex) guide visual attention to extract movement-relevant information (i.e. colour) from visual stimuli. This paper adds to growing evidence that there is a close interaction between the motor system and the attention system. This evidence contradicts the traditional conceptualization of the motor system as the endpoint of a serial chain of processing stages. At the end of the paper we discuss CoRLEGO's predictions and also lessons for neurobiologically inspired robotics emerging from this work. © 2015.       "

For example, the service life of engineering tooling can be extended by using thin film coatings such as titanium nitride (TiN). However, when errors arise in the coating process or when the tooling needs to be re-used it is necessary to remove the coating. Decoating is also useful when a large batch of cutting tools needs to be re-directed for a different application, which requires a new generation of coating. Existing technology uses chemical methods which are not environmentally friendly or ideal for selective removal. In this work, excimer laser striping of TiN from coated tungsten carbide (WC) micro-tools has been demonstrated as a viable alternative to chemical methods. Also, in order to raise the integrity of the decoating process and to make the process more accurate and reliable, two online monitoring systems were developed exploiting probe beam reflection (PBR) and laser plume emission spectroscopy (PES). The online monitoring system facilitated a simultaneous prediction of surface elements as coating layers are progressively removed and ensures better control over the laser irradiation process so as to avoid under or over stripping of the coating. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The dimensionality of the derivation of ADT-CWT feature is further reduced by using RNPDA, which directly obtain a set of optimal eigenvectors with a simple regression framework and thus can overcome the small sample size problem of NPDA.

The classifier exploits the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to obtain complex-valued multiscale representations of training texture samples for each texture class. The high-pass subbands of DT-CWT decomposition of a texture image are used to form a multiscale feature vector representing magnitude and phase features. For computational efficiency, the dimensionality of feature vectors is reduced using principal component analysis (PCA). The class conditional probability density function of low-dimensional feature vectors for each texture class is then estimated by using Parzen-window estimate with identical Gaussian kernels and is used to represent the texture class. A query texture image is classified as the corresponding texture class with the highest a posteriori probability according to a Bayesian inferencing.

However, traditional RFML basically assume that the data of training set and test set are independent and identically distributed and only a large number of labeled data can train a classification model which can effectively classify test set data. In other words, without enough training samples, it is impossible to learn an automatic modulation classifier that performs well in varying noise interference environment. Feature-based transfer learning minimizes the distribution difference between historical modulated signal data and new data by learning similarity-maximizing feature spaces. Therefore, in this paper, Dynamic Distribution Adaptation (DDA) is adopted to address the above challenges. We propose a Tensor Embedding RF Domain Adaptation (TERFDA) approach, which learns the latent subspace of the tensors formed by the time–frequency maps of the signals, so that use the multi-dimensional domain information of the signals to jointly learn the shared feature subspace of the source domain and the target domain, then perform DDA in the shared subspace.

In all cases there is a complex interaction between a turbulent flow field, a strong electric field, a corona discharge and the particle motion. This paper starts with an overview and classification of possible modelling approaches for all major phenomena. Afterwards the manuscript focuses on the modelling of particle dynamics: A Lagrangian, continuous random walk model is compared with an Eulerian approach for a number of test cases. The study is mostly focused on fine particles, i.e. roughly smaller than 100 μm in diameter for the Lagrangian approach and smaller than about 10 μm in the case of Eulerian modelling. It is shown that a local turbulent dispersion coefficient may be derived based on flow field calculations with a constant of proportionality identical to the Lagrangian random walk model. In this case the turbulent dispersion is equally described by both models even for inhomogeneous turbulence. For a superimposed particle drift velocity a model equation introduced by Csanady gives a reasonable agreement. Finally it is shown that modelling of the charging kinetics is a very crucial point in Eulerian modelling. This is demonstrated for the example of electrostatic precipitation where good agreement between Lagrangian and Eulerian modelling is achieved only if local particle charging kinetics is accounted for. Even though Lagrangian particle tracking is still superior in terms of physical modelling of electro-hydrodynamic particulate flows, it is shown that an Eulerian approach may lead to reasonable results with substantially reduced numerical effort. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Challenges in the machining process, especially in the process of grinding Ti-6Al-4V alloy, which is a material with high adhesion, durability, and toughness in combination with poor thermal conductivity that leads to low economic - technical indicators in the grinding process, susceptibility to disabilities of the grinding details, and fast wear of the grinding wheel. Therefore, the precise prediction of the grinding wheel wear and surface roughness in the machining process is a prerequisite to minimize the damages caused by the grinding wheel wear when grinding Ti-6Al-4V alloy. This work presents a model for monitoring grinding wheel wear conditions using the grinding force signal obtained at the processing time in combination with the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system - Gaussian process regression and Taguchi analysis to predict the abrasive wear in the different stages of grinding process. Experimental results show the ability to accurately predict the amount of grinding wheel wear and surface roughness from the proposed model when grinding Ti-6Al-4V alloy. With the ability to accurately predict the indicators of surface roughness and abrasive wear with a corresponding average error of 0.31% and the reliability percentage of the measurement of 98%, the proposed model can be used in the industry for the online forecast of surface roughness and the time to repair the grinding wheel directly in the grinding process. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Molchanov, et al.",2024,Combined control of PM and NOx emissions from small-scale combustions by electrostatic precipitation,10.1016/j.rineng.2024.103255,"Electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) have demonstrated promise in reducing particulate matter (PM) emissions, but their potential for simultaneously reducing NOx in small-scale combustion systems remains largely unexplored. This study examines the potential of ESP with DC corona discharge of negative polarity to reduce both PM and NOx emissions from small-scale combustion. A chemical kinetic model is first developed to predict NOx removal in the ESP. The model accounts for the non-uniform electric field distribution and inhomogeneity of non-thermal plasma in chemical kinetic while remaining simple enough for practical engineering applications. This allows for the optimisation of ESP parameters during the initial design phase. Using this model, the ESP was developed and applied with different energisation regimes to control emissions from a 15 kW pellet combustion heating unit. The initial concentrations for PM and NOx were 48 mg/m3 and 305 mg/m3, respectively (0 °C, 101.3 kPa; at reference O2 = 10 %vol.). The efficiency of the ESP was both theoretically and experimentally determined for various operational regimes at voltages ranging from 6.8 to 11 kV. At 11 kV, the ESP demonstrated a PM removal efficiency of 99.99 % and a NOx removal efficiency of 38 %, achieving compliance with Ecodesign Directive limits. The model's predictions showed reasonable agreement with experimental data, with a slight miscalculation for both particle precipitation and NOx removal. These findings have significant implications for the design and operation of ESPs in small-scale biomass combustion systems, offering a foundation for optimising these devices for combined NOx and particulate matter control. © 2024       "

The optimized acquisition parameters were an 80 s exposure time with three accumulations. Standard solutions were prepared and used to populate a learning database. Two groups of mixed solutions were prepared for a validation database to simulate fermentation at different conditions. First, all spectra of the standards were evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the spectral features of the target substances and observe their distribution and outliers. Second, three multivariate calibration models for prediction were developed using the partial least squares (PLS) method, either on the whole learning database or subsets. The limit of detection (LOD) of each model was estimated by using the root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV), and the prediction ability was further tested with both validation datasets. As a result, improved LODs were obtained: 0.42 and 1.55 g·L−1 for ethanol and glucose using a sub-learning dataset with a concentration range of 0.5 to 10 g·L−1. An interesting prediction result was obtained from a cross-mixed validation set, which had a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for ethanol and glucose of only 3.21 and 1.69, even with large differences in mixture concentrations. This result not only indicates that a model based on standard solutions can predict the concentration of a mixed solution in a complex matrix but also offers good prospects for applying the model in real bioreactors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

"K. Kauffmann, et al.",2020,Alternative type of Ames test allows for dynamic mutagenicity detection by online monitoring of respiration activity,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137862,"The Ames test is the most commonly used mutagenicity test worldwide. It is based on a microbial system that uses histidine auxotrophic Salmonella typhimurium strains. Due to either spontaneous mutations or mutations induced by a mutagenic compound, the cells can regain their ability to grow without histidine supplementation. The degree of mutagenicity of a sample correlates with the number of cells that are able to grow in media that lack histidine. All test variants published up to now are endpoint determinations providing no information about cell growth and respiration activity during the cultivation time. This study aimed to develop an alternative type of Ames test by characterizing the respiration activity of Salmonella typhimurium over time for dynamic mutagenicity detection. It focuses on elucidating the mechanisms underlying this novel test system, and serves as a general proof of principle. Respiration activity (oxygen transfer and uptake rate) and biomass growth of Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 and TA 98 were mechanistically modeled to understand and predict the behavior of the bacteria during the Ames test. The results simulated by the model were experimentally validated by the online monitoring of respiration activity over cultivation time using a Respiration Activity MOnitoring System (RAMOS). The simulated prediction was observed to fit well to the experimental data. When a mutagenic compound was added, its mutagenicity could be detected online due to the elevated cell number and respiration of histidine prototrophic cells. Laborious manual evaluation of mutagenicity after cultivation is not necessary. Mutagenicity evaluation with the presented alternative Ames RAMOS test fitted well to results from an Ames fluctuation test. In the future, a miniaturized RAMOS device for microtiter plates should allow for a high-throughput Ames RAMOS test. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.       "

In the present study, we have proposed a potential model with regard to the online monitoring of the anaerobic digestion process without human intervention. The performance of the biogas digester has been analysed using a novel enhanced methane prediction algorithm (EMPA). The EMPA analyses the internal factors affecting the gas production such as temperature, pH and pressure. The insight of the analysis recommends an appropriate automation to be carried out to enhance the yield of methane production. In this study, the results of the EMPA in predicting the amount of methane production and the time taken to process the dataset are compared with the popular machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, support vector machine and artificial neural networks. Intriguingly, the EMPA has been noted to attain a accuracy (94.84%) in predicting the methane yield, and has taken a less time towards processing the data set. © 2023       "

"A. Schmitt, et al.",2015,Interaction Quality: Assessing the quality of ongoing spoken dialog interaction by experts - And how it relates to user satisfaction,10.1016/j.specom.2015.06.003,"This study presents a novel expert-based approach to assess the quality of ongoing Spoken Dialog System (SDS) interactions. We call this approach ""Interaction Quality"" (IQ). It is an objective measure which relies on statistical classification with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We compare objective expert IQ annotations of ongoing SDS interactions with subjective User Satisfaction (US) ratings and show that IQ and US correlate (ρ=.66). Expert annotations obviously mirror the subjective user impression to a great extent while they are, above all, much easier to obtain. The IQ score that quantifies the quality of the interaction is generated using the median score of exchange annotations of several experts. US is tracked in a study with 38 users interacting with an SDS. A large, comprehensive set of domain-independent, automatic interaction parameters is introduced to quantify the interaction at arbitrary dialog exchanges. Furthermore, a manually annotated negative emotion feature is added to the parameter set in order to evaluate the contribution of emotions on the classification of IQ and US. For evaluation we use the CMU Let's Go bus information system. The model yields a correlation of ρ=.80 when classifying IQ scores annotated in field data from the CMU system. Furthermore, the model achieves ρ=.74 for predicting US on lab data, and ρ=.89 for IQ on lab data. The presented approach outperforms related studies in the field. Only a marginal contribution of the emotion feature to the performance can be observed, implying that US is not influenced by visible emotions. We analyze causalities and correlations between the interaction parameters and the target variables US/IQ and identify relevant predictors. With the presented paradigm, critical dialogs can be found; once deployed as an online monitoring technique, this paradigm could render SDSs more user friendly and improve user acceptance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To overcome the influence of the descending resolution caused by column pollution and the subsequent deterioration of column efficacy at different testing times, we constructed combined peaks by summing the peaks over a specific elution time interval Δt. On constructing tree classifiers, both the original peaks and the combined peaks were considered. A data set of 75 samples from three grades of the same tobacco brand was used to evaluate our method. Two parameters of the random forest were optimized using out-of-bag error, and the relationship between Δt and classification rate was investigated. Experiments show that partial least squares discriminant analysis was not suitable because of the overfitting, and the random forest with the combined features performed more accurately than Naïve Bayes, support vector machines, bootstrap aggregating and the random forest using only its original features. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We pioneered the choice of dual-spectrum technology based on near-infrared (NIR) and ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectra and applied it to the quantitative monitoring of online extraction of puerarin and total flavonoids from Pueraria lobata. An online monitoring system was constructed to fulfill the dual-spectrum online monitoring. The extraction solution flows from a flask into a pipeline under the control of a peristaltic pump, removing the solid residues contained in the solution with filters. When the extraction solution flows into the cuvette, it will be measured with NIR and UV–Vis portable spectrometers. After finishing the spectra collection, the peristaltic pump will reverse to push the extraction solution back to the flask. The partial least squares (PLS) models were established to quantitatively analyze puerarin and total flavonoids by NIR, UV–Vis, and dual-spectrum data. As for NIR, UV–Vis and dual-spectrum, the RMSEP (mg/mL) of the puerarin models were 0.0803, 0.0500, and 0.0351, and those of the total flavonoids models were 0.4373, 0.2402, and 0.1795, respectively. The results show that the dual-spectrum online monitoring system is simple, stable and fast (a few seconds) in operation, and accurate in prediction.

Separating collected PET-PVC mixtures before recycling remains very challenging because of the similar physicochemical properties of PET and PVC. Herein, we describe a novel flotation process with corona modification pretreatment to facilitate the separation of PET-PVC mixtures. Through water contact angle, surface free energy, X-ray photoelectron and FT-IR characterization, we found that polar hydroxyl groups can be more easily introduced on the PVC surface than on the PET surface induced by corona modification. This selective wetting can suppress the floatability of PVC, leading to the separation of PET as floating product.

Therefore, a dynamic response field reconstruction method based on blade tip timing (BTT) data is proposed to evaluate the global vibration state of the rotating bladed disk online in this paper. Firstly, a blade tip vibration decoupling method is proposed to realize the decoupling of the blade tip vibration in Cartesian coordinate system. Secondly, the blade tip vibration phase shift method is proposed, and then the reconstruction of dynamic displacement field and dynamic strain field is realized by combining the improved modal reduction/expansion method.

Since conventional Paris model is only applicable for the single crack, modified Paris model is proposed by introducing the mutual interaction between multiple cracks into stress intensity factor (SIF) expression and utilized to portray multiple fatigue crack growth process. To accurately monitor multi-cracks lengths, Lamb waves are periodically acquired during the fatigue growth of multiple cracks and fed into a deep autoencoder (DAE) network to automatically track response signals variations. Online monitoring model of multi-cracks lengths is then constructed by fitting the mapping relationship between the deep damage feature extracted by the bottleneck layer of DAE network and crack length.

The first method has poor real-time performance for it can only be implemented after machining, making it difficult to adjust grinding processes in time. The second method has not revealed the mechanism of wear, resulting in poor model accuracy and flexibility. Besides, previous models are mainly for cylindrical wheels in surface grinding, while the properties of non-cylindrical wheel wear for gear grinding are different. To address this issue, a novel online monitoring method of non-cylindrical wheel wear for gear grinding is proposed. Firstly, a new parameter is defined based on grain height variation to describe the non-cylindrical wheel wear condition, avoiding the problem of underestimating the actual results due to a small measurement range. Then, a theoretical model for dynamic grinding forces is established considering more grain parameters and more complicated and realistic shape, so that on the basis of that model, the online monitoring method for wheel wear is proposed.

"B. K. Ku, et al.",2002,Electrospray characteristics of highly viscous liquids,10.1016/S0021-8502(02)00075-7,"Electrospray characteristics of highly viscous liquids have been investigated by measuring size distributions of droplets emitted from the Taylor cone using glycerol solutions with various conductivities. Since glycerol volatility is very low, droplet sizes can be measured by an aerodynamic size spectrometer (TSI Aerosizer DSP) with negligible evaporation of droplets. For highly conducting and viscous liquids, the sizes of the droplets electrosprayed from the Taylor cone are found to be relatively insensitive to applied voltages and the electrosprays assisted by the corona discharge produce monodisperse droplets as long as the corona intensity is not too high. Near the minimum flow rate where a liquid cone is stable, the spray tends to consist of a one-peak monodisperse distribution of droplets. However, at higher flow rates, the spray bifurcates into a bimodal distribution. This is consistent with the results of Rosell-Llompart and Fernandez de la Mora (J. Aerosol. Sci. 25 (1994) 1093) for their liquids, which are less viscous than the ones we investigated. Experimental results show that the origin of the bimodal distribution may be due to the lateral instability of the electrically charged viscous jet. For liquid flow rates (Q) below 1 nl/s, the droplet diameters measured by the aerosizer are in the range of 0.30-0.44 μm for the most highly conducting solution. The diameters of monodisperse droplets scale approximately with r*=(Qτ)1/3 (J. Fluid Mech. 260 (1994) 155), where τ is the electrical relaxation time of the fluid. However, when compared with several representative scaling laws, the droplet diameters are two to six times greater than those predicted by the scaling laws. This may be closely related to the combined effect of the much higher viscosity and the electrical charge on the jet breakup of glycerol solution. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A new mesh- generation technique produces body-fitted orthogonal grids with lines similar to the field equipotential and characteristic curves, thus the requirements in grid nodes are kept low and the implementation of the method of characteristics becomes a very easy and fast task. Combining these advantages with a conjugate gradient solver the new methodology achieves high computational efficiency. Details for the convergence history, and the computer time requirements are given to allow comparison with other models. The numerical results are compared with several sets of experimental data from the literature, and their sensitivity to various model parameters (e.g. the corona onset gradient, the ionization zone thickness, and the criterion of convergence) is investigated. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The study is restricted to the asymptotic behaviour of the discharge for large time, and it does not consider its initial or burst phases in detail. One prediction of this model is the existence of a steady state solution to the space charge equations that may lose stability to a travelling wave disturbance which then grows into a strongly pulsed oscillation.

Mathematical modeling of the combined treatment was developed in this work. Efficient removal of the gaseous acetaldehyde was achieved while the corona discharge reactions produced short-lived species such as O and 0 - as well as ozone. Direct contact of the radicals and ions with water was known to produce aqueous OH radical, which contributes to the decomposition of organic contaminants: phenol, absorbed acetaldehyde, and intermediate byproducts in the water. The influence of initial phenol concentration ranging from 15 to 50 mg L-1 and that of influent acetaldehyde ranging from O to 200 ppm were experimentally investigated and used to build the math model. The maximum energetic efficiency of TOC, phenol, and acetaldehyde were obtained at 25.6 × 10-9 mol carbon J -1, 25.0 × 10-9 mol phenol J-1, and 2.0 × 10-9 mol acetaldehyde J-1, respectively.

"W. Zhang, et al.",2011,Effects of cake collapse caused by deposition of fractal aggregates on pressure drop during ceramic filtration,10.1021/es104020p,"A cake collapse model was developed by taking the combined effects of fractal dimension, relaxation ratio, coordination number, and aggregate diameter into consideration. The cake porosity including intraaggregate and interaggregate porosities was modeled successively by three typical coordination numbers (n = 6, 8, and 12). Accordingly, an inversion method made it possible to deduce the coordination number using the measured cake porosities, and the reverse-calculated value with minimum error and the corresponding relaxation ratios were applied as the parameters for the model. As a result, the profiles of intraaggregate and interaggregate porosities and cake porosity were respectively predicted in contrast to the integrated variation of the relaxation ratio and the fractal dimension. Furthermore, a comparison between the model predictions of the cake pressure drop gradients with and without aggregate compression was conducted to validate the presence of cake collapse. The results show that the predictions based on the proposed collapse model are in agreement with the experiments, and the coordination number is one of the key factors that must be incorporated into the cake collapse models. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

This paper proposes an effective method to handle the uneven length problem in multiphase batch processes, which is also useful when the number of training batches is limited. To address the data nonlinearity, two nonlinear modeling techniques are introduced. For online monitoring and quality prediction, a key step is how to locate the current data sample to the specific phase, on which basis an appropriate model can be employed. In this paper, a phase discrimination model for data localization in different phases that is based on the support vector data description model is developed.

Thus, a novel method based on surface desorption chemical ionization mass spectrometry (DAPCI-MS) has been developed for rapid analysis of tea products without any sample pretreatment. Under the optimized experimental conditions, DAPCI MS spectra of various tea samples are recorded rapidly, and the resulting mass spectra are chemical fingerprints that characterize the tea samples. On the basis of the mass spectral fingerprints, 40 tea samples including green tea, oolong tea, and jasmine tea were successfully differentiated by principal component analysis (PCA) of the mass spectral raw data. The PCA results were also validated with cluster analysis and supervised PCA analysis. The alteration of signal intensity caused by rough surfaces of tea leaves did not cause failure in the separation of the tea products. The experimental findings show that DAPCI-MS creates ions of both volatile and nonvolatile compounds in tea products at atmospheric pressure, providing a practical and convenient tool for high-throughput differentiation of tea products. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

This work uses a simple but robust approach to approximate predictive control of average composition and molecular weight during free radical copolymerization, based on detailed kinetics obtained by ACOMP (automatic continuous online monitoring of polymerization reactions). Using these kinetics and elementary computations as a guide, the trends in the composition and molecular weight drifts during synthesis can be approximately controlled by predetermined, constant reagent flows into the reactor (""semibatch"" operation). Two comonomer systems were chosen: one comonomer pair with very different reactivity ratios, having a tendency to high composition drift, and the other one with much closer reactivity ratios resulting in relatively constant composition during batch copolymerization. Each system had high downward molecular weight drift during synthesis, typical of free radical polymerization. Appropriate feed polices were found to control the composition and molecular weight drift tendencies at will; i.e., it was possible to keep composition constant in the first case and to increase or decrease composition in the latter, while desired trends for the average molecular weight were also obtained. The approach allows practical, approximate composition and molecular weight control in free radical copolymerization with simple reactors and pumps and without computationally intensive requirements. The results can also be useful as an Ansatz for reaction trajectory prediction and, together with the online monitoring signals, can be used for feedback controlled corrections to the reagent flows and other reaction conditions. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

Such NLO polymers were processed by spin-coating into planar waveguides ranging from 500 to 1500 nm in thickness. Subsequently, a macroscopic noncentrosymmetric orientation of the NLO-phores was induced by a corona-discharge poling process.

"M. Son, et al.",2011,The effects of flocculation and bed erodibility on modeling cohesive sediment resuspension,10.1029/2010JC006352,"Flocculation and bed erodibility are two main processes causing the transport of cohesive sediments to be more complicated than typical noncohesive sediments. Earlier flocculation models assume a constant fractal dimension and/or a constant floc yield strength. However, recent studies have shown that considering both the fractal dimension and the floc yield strength to be variable is critical to the prediction of temporal evolution of floc size. Due to consolidation, it is also well established that critical bed shear stress of a mud bed cannot be parameterized as a constant. This study further investigates how flocculation models with different degrees of complexity and bed erodibility can affect the resulting cohesive sediment resuspension driven by tidal flows. A one-dimensional vertical numerical model for sediment transport is revised to incorporate modules for flocculation and bed erodibility. Model results are compared with data measured in the Ems/Dollard estuary. Model study suggests that it is important to incorporate variable critical shear stress in order to properly model the supply of sediment from the bed. When flocculation is neglected or incorporated incompletely, numerical model predicts nearly zero sediment concentration during slack water and very steep concentration gradient, which are inconsistent with the observed data. When the fractal dimension and the floc yield strength are both considered to be variable, the numerical model predicts much smaller settling velocity and hence captures the more well-mixed condition consistent with field observations.

Czech, et al.",2018,A Dictionary Approach to Identifying Transient RFI,10.1029/2018RS006538,"As radio telescopes become more sensitive, the damaging effects of radio frequency interference (RFI) become more apparent. One particular approach to mitigating RFI is to deploy independent, omnidirectional wideband monitoring systems at radio telescope arrays. Near such radio telescopes, detected RFI sources are often easily removed or replaced; the challenge lies in identifying them. Transient (impulsive) RFI is particularly difficult to identify. We propose a novel dictionary-based approach to transient RFI identification. RFI events are treated as sequences of subevents, drawn from particular labeled classes. We demonstrate an automated method of extracting and labeling subevents using a data set of transient RFI. A dictionary of labels may be used in conjunction with hidden Markov models to identify the sources of RFI events reliably. We attain improved classification accuracy over traditional approaches such as support vector machines or a naïve k-Nearest Neighbor classifier. Finally, we investigate why transient RFI is difficult to classify. We show that cluster separation in the principal components domain is influenced by the alternating current supply phase for certain sources. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

In the down-converted narrow-band time series, external RFI sources manifest as impulsive noise, often many orders of magnitude stronger than the ionosonde signal of interest. The RFI rejection technique applies a threshold detector to the whitened data, to locate the corrupt samples, and then replaces the bad data using forward and backward linear prediction, based on an autoregressive model of the desired ionosonde signal. Algorithm performance is evaluated using a set of simple statistics and ~6,000 DORS ionograms from central Australia.

EEG-based motor imagery (MI) plays a pivotal role in BCI, enabling the translation of thought into actionable commands for interactive and assistive technologies. However, the constrained decoding performance of brain signals poses a limitation to the broader application and development of BCI systems. In this study, we introduce a convolutional Transformer network (CTNet) designed for EEG-based MI classification. Firstly, CTNet employs a convolutional module analogous to EEGNet, dedicated to extracting local and spatial features from EEG time series. Subsequently, it incorporates a Transformer encoder module, leveraging a multi-head attention mechanism to discern the global dependencies of EEG's high-level features. Finally, a straightforward classifier module comprising fully connected layers is followed to categorize EEG signals. In subject-specific evaluations, CTNet achieved remarkable decoding accuracies of 82.52% and 88.49% on the BCI IV-2a and IV-2b datasets, respectively. Furthermore, in the challenging cross-subject assessments, CTNet achieved recognition accuracies of 58.64% on the BCI IV-2a dataset and 76.27% on the BCI IV-2b dataset.

The intensity of PD defects rises continuously with time, which can lead to insulation degradation and reduced operational life of the electrical equipment. The optimum feature selection of PD signals captured, from different insulation defects, can enhance the classification accuracy of PD defects and facilitate better visualization of PD parameters for electric motor (EM) insulation monitoring and diagnostics. This paper presents a hybrid approach, based on Maximize Relevancy and Minimize Redundancy (mRMR) and random forest (RF), for the optimum feature selection and classification of PD signals in EMs containing multiple defects. For this purpose, four PD defects are developed in the EMs insulation under laboratory conditions, and 800 PD signals are acquired using a conventional IEC-60,270 experimental platform. The severity of these defects is determined and investigated based on PD characteristic parameters. Several features of both PD sweep signals and conventional PD pulses are extracted. Consequently, the mRMR feature selection technique is implemented to select the significant features of the detected PD signals. To establish the plausibility of this technique, several other feature selection algorithms, including RefliefF, Gini Index (GI), and Information Gain (IG), are introduced for the same datasets. The performance of all these feature selection algorithms is validated using three commonly used classification techniques such as RF, support vector machines (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). In summary, the results show that the combination of mRMR and RF proves to be the most effective feature selection algorithm for the classification of insulation defects in EMs, achieving an accuracy of 99.875%. This accuracy is significantly better than other feature selection and classification techniques and indicates its potential for application to other power system components. © The Author(s) 2024.

Effective dynamic spectrum extraction methods can enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of dynamic spectrum data and improve the non-invasive measurement accuracy. According to the principle of DS and the characteristics of the photoplethysmogram (PPG), in this paper, a new dynamic spectrum extraction method based on independent component analysis (ICA) combined with dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) is proposed. The core of this method is to find out the closest ratio between each PPG signal at one wavelength and the template signal of PPGs which represents original blood pulsating information best as DS data. In order to testify the effectiveness of the new proposed method, experiments for the determination of hemoglobin concentration of 151 volunteers based on three different kinds of DS extraction methods coupled with partial least squares (PLS) were conducted respectively, where the root mean square error of the calibration (RMSEC), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), correlation coefficient of calibration (Rc) and correlation coefficient of prediction (Rp) were used as the evaluation index of the prediction performance. Compared with the other two famous DS extraction methods, frequency domain analysis and single trial estimation, ICA combined DTCWT showed better prediction ability.

The prospect of such potential applications, along with the fact that systems with many motors or active elements display interesting cooperative phenomena of fundamental interest, has made the study of synthetic motors an active research area. Janus motors, comprising catalytic and noncatalytic hemispheres, figure prominently in experimental and theoretical studies of these systems. While continuum models of Janus motor systems are often used to describe motor dynamics, microscopic models that are able to account for intermolecular interactions, many-body concentration gradients, fluid flows and thermal fluctuations provide a way to explore the dynamical behavior of these complex out-of-equilibrium systems that does not rely on approximations that are often made in continuum theories. The analysis of microscopic models from first principles provides a foundation from which the range of validity and limitations of approximate theories of the dynamics may be assessed.

Precisely and rapidly determining the sources of spilled oils can provide scientific evidence for the investigation and handling of spilled oil accidents. As traditional fluorescence spectroscopy detects in the linear concentration range, a concentration-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (CRFS) is proposed in this paper, which introduces concentration as a new dimension. A data processing strategy combining multiple algorithms was applied to the CRFS for oil spill identification. Dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) is used to extract multi-scale and multi-directional features of CRFS to ensure the accuracy of identification, while principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensions of the feature spectrum for the purpose of improving the identification speed. Three kinds of artificial neural networks (back propagation neural network (BP), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and generalized regression neural network (GRNN)), which are used as powerful classifiers for oil identification, were compared based on the spectral data processed by DTCWT and PCA. With 100% accuracy, GRNN was proved to be more suitable for oil classification and identification, especially for small sample sizes. The combination of the CRFS technique and this data processing strategy was revealed as a powerful methodology to differentiate a challenging sample set involving diesel (diesel 2002), fuel (heavy fuel 4#) and crude oils (Xia, Shang, Zhengqi), offering potential applications for use in real-time and economic oil fingerprint identification. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

We proceed to understand the general pattern forming potential of aster-motor systems using a computational model of multiple MT asters interacting with motors in cellular confinement. In this model dynein motors are attached to the cell cortex and plus-ended motors resembling kinesin-5 diffuse in the cell interior. The introduction of 'noise' in the form of MT length fluctuations spontaneously results in the emergence of coordinated, achiral vortex-like rotation of asters. The coherence and persistence of rotation require a threshold density of both cortical dyneins and coupling kinesins, while the onset is diffusion-limited with relation to the cortical dynein mobility. The coordinated rotational motion emerges due to the resolution of a 'tug-of-war' of multiple cortical dynein motors bound to MTs of the same aster by 'noise' in the form of MT dynamic instability. This transient symmetry breaking is amplified by local coupling by kinesin-5 complexes. The lack of widespread aster rotation across cell types suggests that biophysical mechanisms that suppress such intrinsic dynamics may have evolved. This model is analogous to more general models of locally coupled self-propelled particles (SPP) that spontaneously undergo collective transport in the presence of 'noise' that have been invoked to explain swarming in birds and fish. However, the aster-motor system is distinct from SPP models with regard to the particle density and 'noise' dependence, providing a set of experimentally testable predictions for a novel sub-cellular pattern forming system.

Therefore, extracting critical features that belong to Alzheimer's signals are useful and tedious for neural network classification due to the high-frequency non-stationary components. For this purpose, time-frequency analysis and the multi-resolution capability of wavelets represent an attractive choice. However, fluctuations of the transformed coefficients and the absence of phase information make the process less accurate in certain scenarios. Because of this, complex wavelet transform has been selected to handle Alzheimer's signals. Moreover, the importance of calculating an optimal threshold value has been highlighted, usually by means of Shannon entropy as a helpful threshold identifier of the complex wavelet transform used to produce significant results. The effectiveness of Tsallis entropy instead of Shannon entropy in handling Alzheimer's signals is evaluated, the former giving place to better features for neural network classification. As a result, accuracy has been improved from 90 to 95% using Tsallis entropy.

The maximum relative differences between the calculation results from the online monitoring data and the icing experiments data do not exceed 18%, which proves the validity of the calculation method of the freezing fraction and collision coefficient in ice accretion model of transmission lines. © 2021 The Authors.

Hussein, et al.",2018,Denoising different types of acoustic partial discharge signals using power spectral subtraction,10.1049/hve.2017.0119,"Measuring acoustic emission (AE) of partial discharge (PD) phenomena can be adopted to estimate the condition of power transformers. However, the environmental noise encountered with AE of PD measurements negatively affects the accuracy of PD localisation and classification. Thus, efficient signal denoising techniques are required for noise suppression and hence, better detection accuracy. This study deals with white noise and it is a continuation of a previously published work that deals with random noise. The published work addresses the random noise suppression using a method named, power spectral subtraction denoising (PSSD). This study applies PSSD to the PD signals contaminated with white noise and uses a novel scheme of noise power spectrum density estimation. Multiple types of AE signals are examined including signals produced by corona, surface, parallel, and void PDs. Synthetic and real data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the wavelet shrinkage denoising method as it can more effectively eliminate white noise and preserve signals of low signal-to-noise ratio. © 2018 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Janani, et al.",2018,Towards automated statistical partial discharge source classification using pattern recognition techniques,10.1049/hve.2018.5048,"This study presents a comprehensive review of the automated classification in partial discharge (PD) source identification and probabilistic interpretation of the classification results based on the relationship between the variation of the phase-resolved PD (PRPD) patterns and the source of the PD. The proposed automated classification system consists of modern, high-performance statistical feature extraction methods and classifier algorithms. Their application in online monitoring and recognition of the PD patterns is investigated based on their low-processing time and high-performance evaluation. The application of modern statistical algorithms and pre-processing methods configured in this automated classification system improves the pattern recognition accuracy of the different PD sources that are suitable to be employed in different high-voltage (HV) insulation media. To evaluate the performance of the different combinations of the feature extraction/classier pairs, laboratory setups are designed and built that simulate various types of PDs. The test cells include three sources of PD in SF6, two sources of PD in transformer oil, and corona in the air. Data samples for different classes of PD sources are captured under two levels of voltage and two different levels of noise. The results of this study evaluate the suitability of the proposed classification systems for probabilistic source identification in various insulation media. Furthermore, of importance to the problem of the PD source identification is to assign a ‘degree of membership’ to each PRPD pattern, besides assigning a class label to it. Some of the classifier algorithms studied in this study, such as fuzzy classifiers, are not only able to show high classification accuracy rate, but they also calculate the ‘degree of membership’ of a sample to a class of data. This enables probabilistic interpretation of a new PRPD pattern that is being classified. The determination of the degree of membership for future PRPD samples allows safer decision making based on the risk associated with the different sources of PD in HV apparatus. © 2018 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Three PD features are extracted from the PD profile, which provides information about physics-of-failure and reflects the degree of insulation degradation. An algorithm fusion extracted from auto-encoder and long short-term recurrent neural network is proposed to synthesize one failure precursor from these three features and make multi-time-step prediction through historical data to provide forewarning. An electrical and thermal accelerated ageing test is performed on the form-wound windings at 0.2 atm to simulate working environment of electric aircraft.

Specifically, a low-cost ultraviolet (UV) sensor detection system was combined with time–frequency method, texture analysis and support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify partial discharge severities for ceramic insulators. The visible images and the root-mean-square value of leakage currents detected simultaneously are used to classify the UV signals into different discharge faults. The frequency and amplitude integration of UV pulses are minimum in corona discharge and larger in arc discharge. The images of UV signal spectrograms differ significantly at different discharge stages. The density and brightness of image textures are minimal in corona discharge and larger in arc discharge.

In this paper, through simplifying interface structure into a coaxial cylindrical model, the formation mechanism of interfacial stress concentration of this interface structure was studied during epoxy resin curing process. The strain and temperature at the interface were measured by the strain and temperature measurement system. Then a model for calculating the interface stress distribution was established, including the heat conduction module, curing dynamics module and curing deformation module. The validity of the model was verified by comparing the calculated results with the measured results. In addition, the air gap defects at the interface, appearing after the curing process, were simulated. The results show that, after the curing process, the first principal stress at the centre of the interface gradually increases from the centre to the edge, reaching 41.06 and 40.20 MPa at the upper and lower edges respectively.

In the current work, ultra-high-frequency (UHF) signals induced by PD current pulses are measured and used to represent PD source. For PD classification, feature parameters need to be extracted from UHF signals. Therefore, this study proposes a new feature extraction method that is based on S-transform (ST) and singular value decomposition (SVD). PD UHF signals generated by four kinds of artificial defects are collected and analysed. ST is used to acquire the joint time-frequency information of the PD UHF signal. SVD is used to acquire the time-frequency characteristics of the UHF signal. Based on the distribution difference of time-frequency characteristics of different kinds of PDs, a 24-demensional feature vector is finally extracted. Support vector machine optimised by particle swarm optimisation algorithm is employed as classifier to recognise the four kinds of PDs. Results show that the proposed feature extraction method can effectively identify the designed four kinds of PDs even with few samples and strong background noise. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Tri-training algorithm and double thresholds set based on Otsu algorithm are used to improve the traditional SVDD classifiers. PD samples collected from different artificial defects models are finally classified by the improved fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm.

Insulated overhead conductor (IOC) faults are often accompanied by partial discharge (PD) phenomenon. Thus, PD monitoring and recognition plays an important role in evaluating the condition of insulation degradation or detecting power line faults. This paper presents a new approach based on a multi-channel CNN-LSTM (convolutional neural network, long short term memory) network for fault detection by determining whether there is local discharge phenomenon on the IOC, in which the three-phase voltage signals are processed with FFT to obtain low frequency and high frequency components, and then the two components together with the original three-phase signals are fed into three parallel CNNs having different filter lengths, and finally LSTM is used to compose those different-scale features sequentially. Then, the fault types are determined according to the result of fault detection.

The potential creeping discharge phenomenon on the insulation board will affect the insulation between the damping capacitors and even the safe operation of the converter valve; therefore, a modified chaos particle swarm optimization multiple signal classification (MCSPO-MUSIC) localization algorithm based on a sparse array was proposed. The performance of the localization algorithm and the sparse array was analyzed by MATLAB simulation, and a test platform was established to detect the insulation board discharge position localization.

Measurements of Saturn's gravity field by Cassini Grand Finale have been acquired with high precision. It has been demonstrated that the even gravitational harmonics J6-J10 have larger absolute values than the predictions by typical rigid-body interior models. A four-layer structure model, proposed to interpret Juno's gravity measurements for Jupiter, has been applied to Saturn, but great attention was paid to the depth of zonal flows in order to interpret the large absolute values of J6-J10. Aims. We aim to understand the internal structure and interior composition of Saturn with a similar model for Jupiter. The additional uncertainties in Saturn's structure and composition are investigated in detail, such as rotation periods, atmospheric helium mass fractions, and flow-induced gravity corrections. Also, we investigate the effect of equations of state for hydrogen and helium on the predictions of the core mass and heavy element abundance. Methods. In the four-layer structure model, we adjusted the heavy element abundances in the outer two envelopes and the mass of the compact core in order to reproduce Saturn's equatorial radius as well as the Cassini Grand Finale gravity measurements corrected by the flow-induced gravity signals. Different four-layer interior models are specified in terms of the rotation period, the atmospheric helium mass fraction, and the flow-induced gravity corrections. Two different ab initio equations of state for hydrogen and helium were used in interior structure calculations. Optimized calculations were then performed to explore Saturn's internal structure and composition. Results. It is found that the absolute values of J6-J10 tend to increase with increasing deep rotation rate and depend on the equations of state adopted in interior calculations. Saturn's deep rotation rate and atmospheric helium mass fraction are important to determine the distribution of helium and heavy elements in the outer envelopes. We also show that the core mass and heavy element abundance in Saturn are dependent upon the deep rotation rate, the atmospheric helium mass fraction, the flow-induced gravity corrections, and the equations of state for hydrogen and helium. © ESO 2020.

The formation of aggregates allowing for percolation paths within the fluid has shown the most promise. This work studies the aggregate formation of a nanofluid and compares the results to earlier thermal conductivity measurements and Monte Carlo simulation results. Static light scattering is employed to measure the fractal dimension of aggregates formed in the nanofluid over time at various temperatures and concentrations. As expected, aggregates form more quickly at higher concentrations and temperatures, which explains the increased enhancement with temperature reported by other research groups. The permanent aggregates in the nanofluid are found to have a fractal dimension of 2.4 and the aggregate formations that grow over time are found to have a fractal dimension of 1.8, which is consistent with diffusion limited aggregation.

The experiments were specially designed to neatly separate the effect of a centered dielectric tube in between the electrodes on the breakdown from the effect of the electric field distribution determined by the electrode geometry on the breakdown. For a given electrode radius and an interelectrode distance, when the diameter of the centered dielectric tube in between the electrodes is smaller, the breakdown voltage is lower, which is most possibly as a result of the flashover more easily happening along the surface of the smaller tube on which the more charged particles are accumulated. When the dielectric tube in between the electrodes is removed, the breakdown voltage depends not only on the product of gas pressure and gap length but also on the aspect ratio of the gas gap, i.e., Ub = f(pd, d/r). Furthermore, Ub = f(pd, d/r) was proved to automatically fulfill two necessary conditions for the similar discharges in the non-uniform electric field, which implies that Ub = f(pd, d/r) is an expression of the similarity theorem in the breakdown of a gap between two plane-parallel electrodes and confirms Townsend's prediction that the general similarity theorem can be applied equally to the breakdowns in non-uniform fields. © 2017 Author(s).

This study experimentally and analytically investigates gas breakdown for gap widths from 1 μm to 25 μm. Using an electrical-optical measurement system with a spatial resolution of 1 μm and a temporal resolution of 2 ns, we measure the breakdown voltages and determine breakdown morphology as a function of the gap width. An empirical fit shows that the breakdown voltage varies linearly with the gap distance at smaller gaps, agreeing with an analytical theory for DC microscale gas breakdown coupling field emission and Townsend avalanche that shows that the slope is a function of field emission properties. Furthermore, the curved breakdown paths captured between 5 μm and 10 μm demonstrate a similar effective length (∼11.7 μm) independent of the gap width, which is consistent with a “plateau” in breakdown voltage. This indicates that Townsend avalanche alone is insufficient to drive breakdown for these gaps and that ion enhanced field emission must contribute, in agreement with theory. The overall agreement of measured breakdown voltage with theoretical predictions from 1 μm to 25 μm indicates the applicability of DC microscale gas breakdown theory to pulsed breakdown, demonstrating that pulsed voltages induce a similar transition from Townsend avalanche to field emission as DC and AC voltages at the microscale. © 2018 Author(s).

The accuracy of the predictions of these models heavily relies on the quality of the set of physical parameters used as, for example, the swarm parameters. A key aspect is the correct representation of the first electron availability which triggers the discharge. These electrons are mainly injected into the gas from the interface between the gas itself and the solid polymeric matrix by means of the Schottky effect. The work function is a very relevant parameter in defining this effect, and so the entire quality of the simulation process depends on it.

Trieschmann, et al.",2021,Kinetic simulation of electron cyclotron resonance assisted gas breakdown in split-biased waveguides for ITER collective Thomson scattering diagnostic,10.1063/5.0055461,"For the measurement of the dynamics of fusion-born alpha particles E α ≤ 3.5 MeV in ITER using collective Thomson scattering (CTS), safe transmission of a gyrotron beam at mm-wavelength (1 MW, 60 GHz) passing the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) in the in-vessel tokamak ""port plug""vacuum is a prerequisite. Depending on neutral gas pressure and composition, ECR-assisted gas breakdown may occur at the location of the resonance, which must be mitigated for diagnostic performance and safety reasons. The concept of a split electrically biased waveguide (SBWG) has been previously demonstrated in C.P. Moeller, U.S. patent 4,687,616 (1987). The waveguide is longitudinally split and a kV bias voltage is applied between the two halves. Electrons are rapidly removed from the central region of high radio frequency electric field strength, mitigating breakdown. As a full scale experimental investigation of gas and electromagnetic field conditions inside the ITER equatorial port plugs is currently unattainable, a corresponding Monte Carlo simulation study is presented. Validity of the Monte Carlo electron model is demonstrated with a prediction of ECR breakdown and the mitigation pressure limits for the above-quoted reference case with 1H2 (and pollutant high Z elements). For the proposed ITER CTS design with a 88.9 mm inner diameter SBWG, ECR breakdown is predicted to occur down to a pure 1H2 pressure of 0.3 Pa, while mitigation is shown to be effective at least up to 10 Pa using a bias voltage of 1 kV. The analysis is complemented by results for relevant electric/magnetic field arrangements and limitations of the SBWG mitigation concept are addressed. © 2021 Author(s).       "

Mai, et al.",2023,Numerical study of electrohydrodynamic atomization considering liquid wetting and corona discharge effects,10.1063/5.0151085,"In this paper, the behavior of the cone-jet mode of fluid by electrohydrodynamic atomization (electrospray) is numerically simulated and investigated with the effect of liquid wetting and corona discharge effects. The simulation was performed with contact angle condition to fit the Taylor cone shape by experiments. Experimental data are provided to verify and validate the numerical method, followed by additional analyses on the effects of electrical conductivity, surface tension, flow rate, and fluid viscosity on the electrospray characteristics, including spray current and jet diameter. Numerical results by simulations are in reasonable agreement with experiments and consistent with the literature. Analyses on different contact angles suggest potentially major impacts of this factor on the cone-jet mode in high voltage and low flow rate circumstances. Furthermore, the influence of corona discharge on electrospray is also investigated by both electrospray-corona simulation and experiment using a high-speed camera, yielding a significant improvement in the numerical prediction for Taylor cone formation. Numerical results indicate that liquid wetting on capillary nozzles would be a vital factor for the Taylor cone formation in numerical electrospray-corona discharge studies. © 2023 Author(s).       "

Shimada, et al.",2023,Evolution of streamer groups and radical generation in high-voltage multiple-pulse-induced nonthermal plasma,10.1063/5.0153451,"Nonthermal plasmas (NTPs) induced by atmospheric nanosecond multiple-pulse corona discharge have been studied to control pollution generated by combustors, such as boilers, incinerators, and diesel engines. In high-speed short-width high-voltage pulsed corona discharge-induced plasmas, the chemical reactions that occur between multiple pulses and the characteristics of the electron density (denoted by ne) and ozone during the second pulse have not been fully clarified. In this study, we perform quasi-two-dimensional numerical analysis of nonequilibrium NTP induced by a nanosecond positive pulsed corona discharge. The continuum fluid equations for a two-temperature nonequilibrium NTP are used as governing equations. A total of 197 gas phase reactions for 25 chemical species and 21 surface reactions on the inner glass wall surface are considered in an air plasma under atmospheric pressure. We simulate streamer group behavior up to the second pulse and found that ne and the length of streamers change due to chemical reactions between pulses. In addition, we successfully simulated the phenomena of ne reduction and streamer suppression that occur primarily during the second pulse. This is caused by the decrease in potential gradient due to the space and dielectric surface charge build-up. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the ozone formation reaction mainly occurs between pulses. This simulation enables predictions of phenomena in nanosecond positive multiple-pulse plasma systems. © 2023 Author(s).       "
"N. Dong, et al.",2023,Prediction model of transformer top oil temperature based on data quality enhancement,10.1063/5.0159072,"Top oil temperature (TOT) is an important parameter to evaluate the running state of a transformer. According to the variation trend of TOT, the internal thermal state of transformers can be predicted so as to arrange operation and maintenance reasonably and prevent the occurrence of accidents. However, due to the complex working environment in the field, there are often a large number of missing values in online monitoring data, which seriously affects the prediction of TOT. At the same time, it is affected by various factors such as load, ambient temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation, which cause the information of different time scales to be mixed in its monitoring data. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve the desired accuracy with a single model. In this article, a model for predicting TOT based on data quality enhancement is proposed. First, the Markov model is used to complete the online monitoring data containing missing values to obtain a complete and continuous time series. Then, using the ensemble empirical modal decomposition method, the time series of TOT is decomposed into multiple time series components to eliminate the interaction between different time scales of information, thus reducing the prediction difficulty. Finally, the sub-prediction model of the extreme learning machine is constructed, and the prediction results of all the sub-models are reconstructed to obtain the final prediction results of TOT. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model, the TOT of an operating transformer for the next two days is predicted in the article, and its mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 5.27% and its root mean square error (RMSE) is 2.46. Compared with the BP neural network model and the support vector machines (SVM) model, the MAPE is reduced by 69.56% and 61.92%, respectively, and the RMSE is reduced by 67.02% and 59.87%. The results of this study will provide important support for the fault diagnosis of the top oil temperature online monitoring system. © 2023 Author(s).       "

Alshaketheep, et al.",2016,Effect of insulator environment on thermal ageing estimations for ethylene propylene rubber insulated nuclear power plant cables,10.1080/00223131.2015.1108881,"ABSTRACT: Thermal ageing estimations merely focus on the degradation of cable insulator materials without considering their arrangement within the cable structure, by surrounding jacket or colorant pigments. This study reconsidered thermal ageing estimations based on the insulator elongation at break (EAB) degradation progress for flame retardant ethylene propylene rubber (FR-EPR) insulators within the whole cable structure. FR-EPR insulators were aged using two methods. In the first method, the insulators were heated, including jacket material at 125 °C, 150 °C, and 160 °C for 2208, 336, and 264 h, respectively. In the second method, the insulators were heated without jacket at 125 °C for 3480 h, and at 160 °C for 264 h. It was expected that the EAB degradation progress would be more severe when the FR-EPR insulators were aged without jacket. However, the results contradicted previous expectations, and the special heat-resistant polyvinyl chloride jacket accelerated the EAB degradation. In addition, the black FR-EPR insulators showed values that deviated from the predictions for the activation energy (Ea) and equivalent times compared to the white and red insulators due to the use of carbon black as a pigment. The reduced equivalent times for thermally aged FR-EPR insulators with jacket in this study were evident compared with the current degradation database for FR-EPR insulators degraded without jacket. © 2016 Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are shifting from one-off and prototyping production to batch, mass, and continuous production. Current AM technologies are mostly focused on small production devices, without monitoring systems. This study aims to bring AM closer to automation by proposing an online monitor system for bottom-up photopolymerization AM (VPP) systems. The sensor-generated data is used to capture the detachment error of built parts from the build platform that otherwise cannot be observed physically by the machine operator. The detachment itself will not stop the build job, which results in lost material and operating time. The online monitoring procedure consists of two phases, an offline and an online one, respectively. The offline phase is used for training a prediction model to be used in connection with a control chart for online monitoring. The monitoring control chart is advantageous as only the detachment predictions need to be recorded. The research carried out in this article brings novelty in both the vat photopolymerization set-up, as well as in an online monitoring procedure that can be easily extended to similar technologies. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The selection of optimum channels that provides the best accuracy is itself a problem to solve because noisy/irrelevant channels can complexify the system and degrade its performance. This paper presents a novel automated model for optimum channel selection for BCI applications using the Fractional Order Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization (FODPSO). To assess the information content of selected channels, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used. The weighted sum of the number of channels and the classification accuracy on validation samples is taken as the fitness value for the FODPSO based binary optimization method (where all the variables are binary). The FODPSO and SVM based algorithm is evaluated on the electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings that have been used in BCI competition III. Dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) is used for preprocessing of the data and sample entropy is calculated for obtaining the most informative features from the preprocessed data. Eight channels are selected using this algorithm, yielding a classification accuracy of 0.81 (Formula presented.) for the testing dataset (classifying the ECoG signals of imagined movement of little finger and tongue) that compares favorably with the already reported methods.

Particle classification and sizing, based on the electrical mobility, ideally requires all the particles being singly charged to the performance enhancement. In this study, we explored the feasibility of maximizing the singly charged fraction of particles via the control of the Nit product in a unipolar charger. The feasibility was first investigated by modeling unipolar diffusion charging. It was found that the singly charged fraction of monodisperse particles could be maximized by the control of the Nit product. A corona-based unipolar charger was also constructed to study the maximization of the singly charged fraction of monodisperse particles. It was found that a wider range of ion concentration in the charging zone could be obtained by the variation of ion-driving voltage compared to that by changing the corona-discharge current. The maximum singly charged fraction of monodisperse particles in various sizes was characterized when the charger was operated at the flow rates of 1.5 and 3.0 lpm. It was evidenced that the current charger could be conditioned to achieve a higher singly charged fraction of particles than that by bipolar chargers in the particle size range of 20–200 nm, particularly in the ultrafine particle size range. The control of Nit product in the charging zone of a unipolar charger offers a simple and effective means to enhance the singly charged fraction of particles in a given size range.

Effect of cross-flow air stream on drying was positive in the range of low velocities, changing to negative at high velocities due to counteracting with EHD flow. Numerical simulation predicted previously unknown effect of EHD flow on the cross-flow air stream, which was quantified as an increase of airway resistance. This prediction was fully validated by experiments.

Owing to a wealth of multiple scattering, the selection of an appropriate model for diverse foliage environments remains a conundrum. Thus the statistical modeling of the foliage clutter in different environments is focused on in this paper. In particular, the primary contribution is to characterize and parameterize the amplitude of the foliage clutter in three typical foliage environments of different densities, including line-of-sight (LOS) forest environment, non line-of-sight (NLOS) forest-penetration environment, and NLOS bush-penetration environment. Based on the real clutter data acquired with an ultra-high frequency (UHF) ultra-wideband (UWB) ground-based radar, the experimental results show that the specific foliage type and configuration has a significant impact on the distribution of foliage clutter. Furthermore, by means of Kullback–Leibler distance (KLD), log-logistic, G 0 and G distributions with estimated parameters are demonstrated to be the best choice to model the clutter in the LOS forest environment, NLOS forest-penetration environment and NLOS bush-penetration environment, respectively.

The applied model allowed to grasp the differences in polarization between 100 and 900 ns PEF and enabled successful prediction of the experimental outcome of propidium iodide electrotransfer into CHO-K1 cells and the conductivity-dependent patterns of MHz range PEF-triggered electroporation were determined. The results of this study form recommendations for development and pre-evaluation of future PEF protocols and generators based on ultra-high frequency electroporation for anticancer and gene therapies. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

"Y. Luo, et al.",2013,Alphanumeric Character Recognition Based on BP Neural Network Classification and Combined Features,10.1080/18756891.2013.816162,"This paper puts forward a new method of alphanumeric character recognition based on BP neural network classification and combined features. This method firstly establishes three BP networks respectively for three categories of characters which are classified according to their Euler numbers, with the combination of grid feature and projection feature as the input of each BP network. When recognizing a character, its combined features are fed into the three BP networks simultaneously without the necessity for judging its Euler number. The final recognition result is elaborated by synthetically analyzing the outputs of three BP networks. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the recognition ability and efficiency, and has a good property of fault tolerance and robustness. Furthermore, the weight coefficients of combined features for each BP network are optimized, which can further improve the recognition rate. © 2013 Copyright the authors.       "

Interference from fabric background texture affects the accuracy of computer-aided pilling ratings. A new approach for pilling evaluation based on the multi-scale two-dimensional dualtree complex wavelet transform (CWT) is presented in this paper to extract the pilling information from pilled fabric images. The CWT method can effectively decompose the pilled fabric image with six orientations at different scales and reconstruct fabric background texture and pilling sub-images. This study used an energy analysis method to search for an optimum image decomposition scale and dynamically discriminate pilling image from noise, fabric texture, fabric surface unevenness, and illuminative variation in the pilled fabric image. For pilling objective rating, six parameters were extracted from the pilling image to describe pill properties. A Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural rule was used as a classifier to classify the pilling grade. The proposed method was evaluated using knitted, woven, and nonwoven pilled fabric images photographed with a digital camera. © 2011 The Textile Institute.       "

Particles were generated by (1) evaporation-condensation or (2) corona discharge upon a vapor mixture of water and benzene. Ion clusters were produced by passing air containing organic vapors through an Am-241 ionizer. The theory of Cheng and Yeh predicts reasonably well the penetration of particles with sizes down to about 2 nm. For smaller particles, penetration attains a constant value seemingly dependent on the chemical nature of the material. Neither the constancy of this value nor its dependency on material properties can be explained by this theory. Inclusion of thermal rebound phenomena (sticking probability) in the model would probably explain the observed results.

This process is reasonably well understood for strongly non-uniform insulation gaps ('point-to-plane') and in the absence of pre-breakdown discharge activity ('corona stabilization'). Open questions still remain for weakly non-uniform insulation gaps with small electrode protrusions (particles, surface roughness), in which pre-breakdown partial discharge (PD) activity is present. This paper presents a first attempt to derive a consistent picture under these conditions, which are characteristic for practical gas insulation systems. Experiments were carried out in a uniform field gap with a short protrusion on one electrode. This configuration was studied at various pressures from 0.1 to 0.5 MPa and both polarities using electrical and optical diagnostics. The results are interpreted using a quantitative model and order-of-magnitude estimates. The emerging picture allows prediction of most of the technically relevant aspects of the discharge processes and their main parameter dependences.

Despite its widespread use some important parameters, like the properties of streamers, are still not sufficiently understood. Since breakdown in SF6 always occurs via the streamer-leader transition the streamer properties are decisive for leader inception and, therefore, breakdown of the insulation. Important parameters are, for example, the streamer radius and the streamer propagation length of arrested streamers. Such properties enter in breakdown prediction models. In the present study the streamer radius and the propagation length were investigated experimentally at 50 and 100 kPa for both polarities using strongly and weakly non-uniform background fields. No experimental information was available so far for negative polarity. The resulting streamer radius scaling agrees with previous experimental results for positive polarity and with expectations from breakdown models for negative polarity. These results were similar for strongly non-uniform and weakly non-uniform background fields. A difference between the two setups was observed for the streamer lengths. It was found that for strongly non-uniform fields the streamer length scales as expected with the critical electric field but with a different field for weakly non-uniform background fields. This was similar for both polarities. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.       "

Despite the fact that OCT is capable of acquiring high resolution circumferential images of vessels, many distinct histological features of a vessel have comparable optical properties leading to poor contrast in OCT images. Two classification methods were tested in this report for the purpose of enhancing contrast between soft-tissue components of porcine coronary vessels. One method involved analyzing the attenuation of the OCT signal as a function of light penetration into the tissue. We demonstrated that by analyzing the signal attenuation in this manner we were able to differentiate two media sub-layers with different orientations of the smooth muscle cells. The other classification method used in our study was fractal analysis. Fractal analysis was implemented in a box-counting (fractal dimension) image-processing code and was used as a tool to differentiate and quantify variations in tissue texture at various locations in the OCT images. The calculated average fractal dimensions had different values in distinct regions of interest (ROI) within the imaged coronary samples. When compared to the results obtained by using the attenuation of the OCT signal, the method of fractal analysis demonstrated better classification potential for distinguishing amongst the tissue ROI. © 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

The suitability of the coherence and the fractal dimension to monitor tumour response was evaluated in 18 patients with limb sarcomas imaged by DCE-MRI pre- and post-treatment. According to the histopathology, tumours were classified into responders and non-responders. Pharmacokinetic (Ktrans) and heuristic model-based parametric maps (slope, max enhancement, AUC) were computed from the DCE-MRI data. A substantial correlation was found between the pharmacokinetic and heuristic model-based parametric maps: ρ = 0.56 for the slope, ρ = 0.44 for maximum enhancement, and ρ = 0.61 for AUC. From all four parametric maps, the enhancing fraction, and the heterogeneity features (i.e. coherence and fractal dimension) were determined. In terms of monitoring tumour response, using both pre- and post-treatment DCE-MRI, the enhancing fraction and the coherence showed significant differences between the response group and the non-response group (i.e. the highest sensitivity (91%) for K trans, and the highest specificity (83%) for max enhancement). In terms of treatment prediction, using solely the pre-treatment DCE-MRI, the enhancing fraction and coherence discriminated between responders and non-responders. For prediction, the highest sensitivity (91%) was shared by Ktrans, slope and max enhancement, and the highest specificity (71%) was achieved by Ktrans. On average, tumours that responded showed a high enhancing fraction and high coherence on the pre-treatment scan. These results suggest that specific heterogeneity features, computed from both pharmacokinetic and heuristic model-based parametric maps, show potential as a biomarker for monitoring tumour response. © 2011 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

More specifically, some types of PD can be classified as having a detrimental effect on the integrity of the insulation while others can be deemed relatively harmless, rendering the correct classification of different PD types of vital importance to electrical utilities. In this work, a feature vector was proposed based on higher order statistics on selected nodes of the wavelet packet transform (WPT) coefficients of time domain measurements, which can compactly represent the characteristics of different PD sources. To assess its performance, experimental data acquired under laboratory conditions for four different PD sources encountered in power systems were used. The two learning machine methods, namely the support vector machine and the probabilistic neural network, employed as the classification algorithms, achieved overall classification rates of around 98%. In comparison, the utilization of the scaled, raw WPT coefficients as a feature vector resulted in classification accuracy of around 99%, but with a significantly higher number of dimensions (1304 to 16), validating the PD identification ability of the proposed feature. Dimensionality reduction becomes a key factor in online, real-time data collection and processing of PD measurements, reducing the classification effort and the data-storage requirements. Therefore, the proposed method can constitute a potential tool for such online measurements, after addressing issues related to on-site measurements such as the rejection of interference. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

While existing literature mentions several potential mechanisms for this reduction, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the associated effects is lacking. This research paper addresses this knowledge gap by providing a quantitative estimation of the combined impact of water on the gas’s ionization yield (effective ionization coefficient) and the modification of the gap electric field caused by water absorption into the bulk of the insulating coating and the associated microscopic and macroscopic polarization processes (dielectric permittivity). However, a comparison of the theoretical predictions with experimental data reveals that these factors alone cannot fully account for the observed reduction in PDIV. Therefore, the study explores additional mechanisms mentioned in the literature, with particular focus on the development of a semi-conductive layer on the insulation coating in humid atmospheres. The numerical simulations of the surface charge dynamics within this layer suggests that the frequency-dependent decrease in PDIV under high-humidity atmospheres can indeed be attributed to the modification of the gap electric field due to the accumulation of surface charge in the semi-conductive layer. © 2023 The Author(s).

Three materials, perfluoralkoxy alkane, sealed and unsealed alumina (UA), are employed as the dielectric coating (insulation) of test samples. Each material’s dielectric properties change differently with RH—of these, relative permittivity is regarded as the most crucial, as it was previously proven to be, along with the coating’s thickness, the key factor in determining the PDIV in dry air conditions. To further vary the value of permittivity and thus provide larger data sets for the verification study, the frequency of the excitation voltage is also varied between 1 Hz and 50 kHz. The obtained experimental data are compared against the PDIV predictions obtained by a breakdown model based on the reduced thickness of the coating (ratio of the coating thickness to its relative permittivity). Satisfying agreement between the measured and predicted PDIV are obtained for the first two materials, whereas significant discrepancies are seen for the UA material. For this case, surface conductivity is introduced into the prediction model and much better fits to the experimental data are obtained for a suitable value of surface resistance.

Due to total reflection, AE sensors cannot always detect the signal of a direct wave. As a result, localisation algorithms based on an indirect wave can be more accurate. But little research has addressed arrival time (AT) methods of indirect PD signals. In this paper, a double-threshold (DT) method is introduced, and its improvement based on short-time energy and a zero-crossing rate is described. Because an indirect wave arrives earlier and has lower energy than a direct wave, current AT methods, such as the energy criterion, cross-correlation, and linear prediction residual methods, cannot determine its AT. However, the proposed DT method can determine the AT precisely.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel federated deep learning (FDL) for the diagnosis of partial discharge (PD) in GIS. A federated learning (FL) based on an improved federated averaging algorithm is proposed, which allows different clients to collaboratively participate in model training and preserves data privacy.

First, a novel 1DCNN is constructed to achieve high-accuracy classification using unbalanced samples, where the problem of traditional two-dimensional CNN's dependence on sample size is solved. Second, DATL is used to realize on-site GIS PD pattern recognition using small samples containing some unlabeled samples.

The main objective is to determine the optimal measurement cycle duration for accurate defect recognition, thereby enhancing the reliability of PD-based diagnostic techniques. Totally 14 cable joints, each containing three different types of prefabricated artificial defects, were analyzed across five different measurement cycle durations: 40, 80, 120, 200, and 1200 cycles. Subsequently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed for defect recognition analysis. The results reveal a significant impact of measurement cycle duration on defect recognition accuracy. Particularly, a CNN based on 200 measurement cycles demonstrates superior performance compared to models with fewer cycles, achieving a total defect recognition accuracy of 100%. This finding underscores the importance of sufficient measurement cycles for obtaining comprehensive PRPD patterns and accurate defect classification. Furthermore, the study highlights the significance of setting a threshold value to mitigate false conditions in defect type recognition, offering valuable insights for practical applications in power system maintenance and diagnostics. Overall, this research contributes to advancing the understanding of PD-based insulation assessment techniques and provides practical recommendations for optimizing measurement cycle duration to enhance defect recognition accuracy in high voltage power cable joints. © 2024 The Author(s).

Wang, et al.",2024,Multi-source domain adaptation network for partial discharge severity assessment in gas-insulated switchgear,10.1088/1361-6501/ad7488,"Gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) partial discharge (PD) severity assessment is critical for ensuring the reliable operation of GIS systems. However, existing assessment methods often overlook the long-term dependencies of historical data and fail to adequately address challenges related to limited on-site samples and variations in sample distribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-source domain adaptation network (MSDAN) specifically designed for on-site GIS PD severity assessment, which is the first model developed considering distribution differences in GIS PD severity assessment for different defect types. Our approach begins with the development of a feature extractor that captures both discernible PD features and long-term dependencies. We then introduce a multi-source domain adaptation strategy to mitigate distribution disparities across PD severity samples from different defect types, ensuring effective domain alignment. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive weighted classification mechanism to accurately assess PD severity by considering the varying contributions of different defect types to the target domain task. Experimental results demonstrate that MSDAN achieves a remarkable accuracy of 95.38% in on-site GIS PD severity assessment, outperforming other benchmark models in both accuracy and robustness. This highlights the potential of MSDAN as a robust solution for real-world GIS PD severity assessment. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Our results are consistent with the Coulomb gas predictions for the critical O(n) branch for n < 2 and the results obtained by previous transfer matrix calculations. For n = 2, we find that the thermal exponent, the magnetic exponent and the fractal dimension of the largest critical Eulerian bond component are different from those of the critical O(2) loop model.

However, the fluid model requires specification of the electron energy distribution function (EEDF); the common assumption of a Maxwellian EEDF can result in the inaccurate breakdown prediction when the electrons are not in equilibrium. We confirm that the influence of the incident pulse shape on the EEDF is tiny at high pressures by using the particle-in-cell Monte Carlo collision (PIC-MCC) model. As a result, the EEDF for a rectangular microwave pulse directly derived from the Boltzmann equation solver Bolsig+ is introduced into the fluid model for predicting the breakdown threshold of the non-rectangular pulse over a wide range of pressures, and the obtained results are very well matched with those of the PIC-MCC simulations. The time evolution of a non-rectangular pulse breakdown in gas, obtained by the fluid model with the EEDF from Bolsig+, is presented and analyzed at different pressures.

However, its performance at low air pressures remains to be clarified. An experiment of measuring the EHD force at 0.02 atm-1.0 atm (1 atm = 1.01325×105 Pa) is carried out with the wire-to-cylinder geometric structure. The ion distribution is analyzed by using the drift-diffusion model with two-dimensional numerical simulation. The experimental result shows that the EHD force is not linearly related to the corona discharge current at low air pressures. Numerical simulation finds that the proportion of ions in the counter-direction electric field increases from approximately 0.36% to 30% when the pressure drops from 1.0 atm to 0.2 atm. As a result, the EHD force with a constant power supply drops faster than the previous theoretical prediction in the ground experiment, suggesting that the consideration of counter-direction EHD force is necessary to improve the ionic wind propulsion efficiency in near-space applications. © 2023 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

"D. Moreau, et al.",2024,Model-predictive kinetic control with data-driven models on EAST,10.1088/1741-4326/ad893b,"In this work, model-predictive control (MPC) was combined for the first time with singular perturbation theory, and an original plasma kinetic control method based on extremely simple data-driven models and a two-time-scale MPC algorithm has been developed. A comprehensive review is presented in this paper. Slow and fast semi-empirical models are identified from data, by considering the fast kinetic plasma dynamics as a singular perturbation of a quasi-static equilibrium, which itself is governed, on the slow time scale, by the flux diffusion equation. This control technique takes advantage of the large ratio between the time scales involved in magnetic and kinetic plasma transport. It is applied here to the simultaneous control of the safety factor profile, q(x), and of several kinetic variables, such as the poloidal beta parameter, βp, and the internal inductance parameter, li, on the EAST tokamak. In the experiments, the available control actuators were lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) and co-current neutral beam injection (NBI) from different sources. Ion cyclotron resonant heating (ICRH) and electron cyclotron resonant heating (ECRH) are used as additional actuators in control simulations. In the controller design, an observer provides, in real time, an estimate of the system states and of the mismatch between measured and predicted outputs, which ensures robustness to model errors and offset-free control. Based on the observer information, the controller predicts the behavior of the system over a given time horizon and computes the optimal actuation by solving a quadratic programming optimization problem that takes the actuator constraints into account. A number of control applications are described in the paper, either in nonlinear simulations with EAST-like parameters or in real experiments on EAST. The simulations were performed with a fast plasma simulator (METIS) using either two control actuators (LHCD and ICRH) in a low density scenario, or up to four actuators at higher density: LHCD, ECRH, and two NBI systems driven in a on/off pulse-width-modulation (PWM) mode, with different injection angles. The control models are identified with the prediction-error method, using datasets obtained from open loop simulations in which the actuators are modulated with pseudo-random binary sequences. The simulations with two actuators show that various q(x) profiles and βp waveforms can be tracked without offset, within times that are consistent with the resistive and thermal diffusion time scales, respectively. In simulations with four actuators, simultaneous tracking of time-dependent targets is shown for q(x) at two normalized radii, x = 0 and x = 0.4, and for βp. Due to the inherent mismatch between the optimal NBI power request and the delivered PWM power, the kinetic controller performs with reduced accuracy compared with simulations that do not use the NBI/PWM actuators. The first experimental tests using this new control algorithm were performed on EAST when the only available actuator was the LHCD system at 4.6 GHz. The algorithm was thus used in its simplest single-input-single-output version to track time-dependent targets for the central safety factor, q0, or for βp. In the closed loop control experiments, the q0 targets were tracked in about one second, consistently with the plasma resistive time constant. Excellent tracking of a piecewise linear βp target waveform was also achieved. When the NBI system became controllable in real time by the EAST plasma control system, new experiments were dedicated to multiple-input-multiple-output MPC control with three actuators: LHCD and two NBI actuators using the PWM algorithm. Given that the minimum time allowed between NBI on/off switching was 0.1 s, i.e. larger than the characteristic time of the fast plasma dynamics, a reduced version of the MPC controller based only on the slow model was used. Various controller configurations were tested during a single experimental session, with up to three controlled variables chosen among q0 = q(x = 0), q1 = q(x = 0 5), βp and li. The main difficulty encountered during this session was the unavailability of the full baseline ICRH and ECRH powers that were used in the reference scenario, and from which the plasma model was identified. This often led to the saturation of one or several actuators, which prevented some targets selected in advance from being accessible. Nevertheless, in cases that were free from actuator saturation, q0 and q1 targets were successfully reached, in a time that is consistent with the resistive diffusion time of the model and with small oscillations that are characteristic of the PWM operation of the neutral beams. During the simultaneous control of q0 and βp, the ICRH power was too low and, in addition, the plasma density was much larger than the reference one. The q0 targets were not accessible in this high-density/low-power case, but βp control was successful. Finally, the simultaneous control of q0 and li was satisfactory and, during the simultaneous control of, q0, βp and li, the tracking of βp and li was satisfactory but q0 was too large due to the lack of ICRH power and to NBI saturation. In conclusion, the extensive nonlinear simulations described in this paper have demonstrated the relevance of combining MPC, data-driven models and singular perturbation methods for plasma kinetic control. This technique was also assessed experimentally on EAST, although some tests were perturbed by undesired parameter changes with respect to the reference scenario. © 2024 The Author(s).       "

Zaccone, et al.",2009,Breakup of dense colloidal aggregates under hydrodynamic stresses,10.1103/PhysRevE.79.061401,"Flow-induced aggregation of colloidal particles leads to aggregates with fairly high fractal dimension (df □2.4-3.0) which are directly responsible for the observed rheological properties of sheared dispersions. We address the problem of the decrease in aggregate size with increasing hydrodynamic stress, as a consequence of breakup, by means of a fracture-mechanics model complemented by experiments in a multipass extensional (laminar) flow device. Evidence is shown that as long as the inner density decay with linear size within the aggregate (due to fractality) is not negligible (as for df □2.4-2.8), this imposes a substantial limitation to the hydrodynamic fragmentation process as compared with nonfractal aggregates (where the critical stress is practically size independent). This is due to the fact that breaking up a fractal object leads to denser fractals which better withstand stress. In turbulent flows, accounting for intermittency introduces just a small deviation with respect to the laminar case, while the model predictions are equally in good agreement with experiments from the literature. Our findings are summarized in a diagram for the breakup exponent (governing the size versus stress scaling) as a function of fractal dimension. © 2009 The American Physical Society.       "

Here we propose a model for a geographical network with nodes embedded in a fractal space in which we can tune the network heterogeneity by varying the strength of the spatial embedding. When the nodes in such networks have power-law distributed intrinsic weights, the networks are scale-free with the degree distribution exponent decreasing with increasing fractal dimension if the spatial embedding is strong enough, while the weakly embedded networks are still scale-free but the degree exponent is equal to γ=2 regardless of the fractal dimension. We show that this phenomenon is related to the transition from a noncompact to compact phase of the network and that this transition accompanies a drastic change of the network efficiency. We test our analytically derived predictions on the real-world example of networks describing the soil porous architecture. © 2011 American Physical Society.       "

Experimental results make it clear that the total charge transfer, due to the partial discharges, is increased by temperature. A possible explanation of the undergoing physical process may be the following: In the low field regime, temperature perturbation effects on the injected current are characterized by the conductivity changes in the volume of the dielectric. The onset for partial discharges appears to be temperature dependent (under constant applied field conditions). As partial discharges start occurring, avalanche multiplication of conduction electrons appears to be the dominant phenomenon characterizing the behavior of a ‘metal/thick insulator/metal’ structure in the high field regime. A breakdown prediction might be possible if the threshold electric field for partial discharge initiation was known. As a practical application, impulse tests in high-power transformers must occur immediately after the temperature overheat tests in order to account for the enhanced partial discharge phenomena, brought about by a temperature increase in the volume of the dielectric. © 1990 IEEE       "

The major problem encountered in the latter measurements is the strong coupling of external noises particularly from discrete spectral interferences (DSI) e.g. broadcasting stations as well as impulsive disturbances. A critical study of the performance of several digital filters for rejecting DSI is reported. The filters are evaluated with particular reference to distortion introduced on successive PD pulses. A new digital filtering method based on a cascaded 2nd order IIR lattice notch filter has been proposed. The study showed that, for similar performance, methods based on linear prediction required longer filter orders when compared to cascaded IIR notch filters. The non-adaptive methods were found to be stable against impulsive disturbances while adaptive methods were unstable. The new method proposed in this paper gave the best performance, low distortion to a sequence of PD pulses, good stability and fast filtering time. The performance at higher sampling rates, even with PD pulses of long widths was also found to be superior.

The experimental data were in good agreement with the theoretical predictions; the saturation charge increases linearly with the applied voltage, up to a threshold at which the self discharge of the particle occurs. The efficiency of ionic charging was shown to depend on the type of corona electrode that is employed. ©1998 IEEE.       "

Feng, et al.",2001,Steady-state corona charging behavior of a corotron over a moving dielectric substrate,10.1109/28.968174,"Charging up a dielectric surface through corona discharge from a thin wire has been a common practice in electrophotographic processes. One of the widely used corona charging devices is called a corotron, which consists of a coronating wire enclosed in a rectangular shield with one constituent side being the surface to be charged. Uniform surface charge can be deposited on a dielectric substrate, such as a photoreceptor in the absence of light, by moving the substrate at a constant velocity through a stationary corotron that consistently emits corona current. To design an efficient corotron for charging dielectric substrates, a fundamental understanding of the electrostatic nature of the device is desired. In this paper, the steady-state behavior of corona charging with a corotron over a moving dielectric substrate is analyzed by computationally solving the nonlinearly coupled equation system with Galerkin finite-element method and Newton iterations. The predictions based on a first-principle model are shown to agree well with experimental measurements.       "

"S. R. Campbell, et al.",1994,Practical on-line partial discharge tests for turbine generators and motors,10.1109/60.300147,"Several utilities have found partial discharge testing to be very useful for identifying motors or generators with deteriorated stator winding insulation. Such partial discharge tests are sensitive to problems associated with overheated insulation, loose stator bars, and pollution, all of which can cause in-service failures with long associated outages and high repair/rewind costs. Unfortunately, the partial discharge test is not widely applied since present test methods require considerable skill to perform, and/or require machine outages. These problems are due to the stator winding partial discharges being masked by high levels of internal and external electrical noise. Partial discharge tests have now been developed which eliminate the effect of noise, thus allowing plant personnel to perform the test without any machine outage. Two broad types of noise exist: arcing from slip rings shaft grounding brushes, etc. within the machine (internal noise); and arcing and partial discharge from the bus connecting the machine to the power system (external noise). Installations on several machines have shown that external noise can be eliminated by a pair of capacitive couplers (bus couplers) mounted on each phase of the output bus. Sensors which are mounted within the slots of the stator winding (SSCs) have been shown to eliminate both external and internal noise. An instrument called the TGA has been developed to measure the signals from either type of sensor, distinguish noise from stator winding partial discharge, and perform a pulse height, pulse phase analysis on the partial discharge signals. Using the TGA, deteriorated windings have been found to have as much as 20 times higher partial discharge activity than good windings. The SSC type of sensor is best for use on large turbine generators or other critical machines, due to its ability to effectively eliminate false indications of deteriorated windings. © 1993 IEEE       "

Braun, et al.",1993,Reliability of gis ehv epoxy insulators: The need and prospects for more stringen. acceptance criteria,10.1109/61.180327,"High reliability of gas insulated switchgear (GIS) is essential. However, more demanding partial discharge (PD) acceptance criteria for GIS insulators are required at the higher voltage classes to maintain these high levels of reliability. In addition to increased operating stresses and greater manufacturing difficulties, fundamental limitations exist which lessen PD detection sensitivity of large physical objects. PD scaling relationships are presented, based on a recently developed theory, which enable prediction of PD magnitude in equivalent defects in different insulators. For example, PD magnitudes of 2 to 5 pC (the current acceptance criterion) in a 138 kV insulator correspond to magnitudes of 05 to 1.2 pC for 550 kV insulators, based on certain assumptions. In effect, defects with greater severity would thus be passed in present factory tests for 550 kV insulators. To maintain the high levels of reliability that manufacturers and users alike have come to expect, PD acceptance criteria of 05 to 1.0 pC are proposed for 550 kV insulators to obtain a standard of severity equivalent to that in existence at 138 kV. To achieve this level of testing, a number of techniques, including ultra wideband measurements, are proposed to improve present PD detection technology by at least two orders of magnitude. Sensitivities of better than 0.01 pC at up to 400 kV were routinely achieved in a factory-like environment. © 1993 IEEE       "

With the results considered, the mechanisms of PD were discussed. Moreover, we discussed the possibility of breakdown prediction in GIS. An attempt was made to find a breakdown prediction parameter which characterized the change of PD type: the ratio RL of maximum charge to the average charge of PD pulses appearing in the phase region near the peak in positive half cycle.

Partial discharges (PD) occurring in all HV insulation systems is a very complex phenomenon, and more so are the shapes of the various 3-d patterns obtained during routine tests and measurements. It has been fairly well established that these pattern shapes and underlying defects causing PD have a 1:1 correspondence, and therefore methods to describe and quantify these pattern shapes must be explored, before recognition systems based on them could be developed.

The degradation monitoring task can be mapped as a classification problem: given the Acoustic Emission(AE) events at a given timeslot, the model is expected to predict which one of the following three stages the material is in: elastic, matrix-driven and fiber-driven cracking. In this paper, degradation tests on SiCf-SiCm composite tubes were conducted using a bladder-based internal pressure technique with AE monitoring. We then trained a deep learning based end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) model for online monitoring of the damage progression process of SiCf-SiCm composite tubes using the AE data as the raw input. As a comparison, we also applied Random Forest (RF) with expert-crafted audio event features to the damage stage prediction problem. Experimental results show that both RF and CNN models yield good results but on average our end-to-end CNN models outperform the RF models due to its high-level feature extraction capability. The CNN model with single events can reach an average prediction accuracy of 84.4% compared to 74% of the RF models. Combining multiple audio samples typically improves the accuracy of the models with RF accuracy reaching 82.8% and CNN accuracy reaching 86.6%. © 2013 IEEE.       "

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel MobileNets convolutional neural network (MCNN) model to identify the GIS PD patterns. We first construct the PD pattern recognition classification datasets by means of experiments and FDTD simulation, and also preprocess images via binarization processing. After constructing the MCNN model, depthwise separable convolutions and an inverse residual structure are adopted to deal with the vanishing gradient of the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in the GIS PD pattern recognition process. Then, through the graphics standardization process, the MCNN model is trained and tested. The whole training process is visualized by Tensorboard. Compared with other deep learning models and traditional machine learning methods, MCNN particularly stands out in recognition accuracy and time consumption with a 96.5% overall recognition rate and merely 7.3 seconds in training time. This research explores how to optimize the model by improving the recognition accuracy, and by reducing its computing load, storage space and energy consumption for better incorporation into intelligent terminals in the UPIoT context. © 2013 IEEE.

Emotion recognition is considered a highly valuable aspect of EC. Numerous studies have examined emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, but the recognition rate is unreliable. In this paper, a feature extraction method is proposed that is based on double tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) and machine learning. The emotions of 16 subjects are induced under video stimulation, and the original signal is acquired using a Neuroscan device. Both EEG and electromyography (EMG) signal are then eliminated by band-pass filtering, and the reconstructed signal of each frequency band is obtained by DTCWT. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is utilized to classify three kinds of emotions: calm, happy, and sad, obtaining a classification accuracy of 90.61%.

Accurate prediction of PV power output can not only reduce the impact of PV power generation on the grid but also provide a reference for grid dispatching. Therefore, this paper proposes an LSTM-attention-embedding model based on Bayesian optimization to predict the day-ahead PV power output. The statistical features at multiple time scales, combined features, time features and wind speed categorical features are explored for PV related meteorological factors. A deep learning model is constructed based on an LSTM block and an embedding block with the connection of a merge layer. The LSTM block is used to memorize and attend the historical information, and the embedding block is used to encode the categorical features. Then, an output block is used to output the prediction results, and a residual connection is also included in the model to mitigate the gradient transfer. Bayesian optimization is used to select the optimal combined features. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified on two actual PV power plants in one area of China.

Their reliability and availability can lead to significant benefits. For decades, monitoring and diagnosis of hydrogenerators have been at the core of maintenance strategies. A significant part of generator diagnosis relies on Partial Discharge (PD) measurements, because the main cause of hydrogenerator breakdown comes from failure of its high voltage stator, which is a major component of hydrogenerators. A study of all stator failure mechanisms reveals that more than 85% of them involve the presence of PD activity. PD signal can be detected from the lead of the hydrogenerator while it is running, thus allowing for on-line diagnosis. Hydro-Québec has been collecting more than 33 000 unlabeled PD measurement files over the last decades. Up to now, this diagnostic technique has been quantified based on global PD amplitudes and integrated PD energy irrespective of the source of the PD signal. Several PD sources exist and they all have different relative risk, but in order to recognize the nature of the PD, or its source, the judgement of experts is required. In this paper, we propose a new method based on visual data analysis to build a PD source classifier with a minimum of labeled data. A convolutional variational autoencoder has been used to help experts to visually select the best training data set in order to improve the performances of the PD source classifier. © 2013 IEEE.

In order to address this issue, much effort has been made before to assess the reliability of drive motor in the EVs. However, drive motor and motor controller are logically integrated and requested to work as one system in the EVs. In contrast to the individual reliability analysis of them, the combined assessment of the two parts can provide a more reliable prediction to the reliability of the entire motor system. Moreover, both drive motor and motor controller are composed of multiple components. The structure, type, and characteristics of these components may affect the reliability of the motor system as well. But these issues have not been considered in the previous research. In order to fill this gap of knowledge, the reliability of the entire motor system of pure electric vans that includes both drive motor and motor controller is investigated in this paper. In the research, the theoretical failure rates of subassemblies and components in drive motor and motor controller are predicted first. Then based on the failure rate prediction results, the reliability of the entire motor system (comprising both drive motor and motor controller) is assessed. Based on the assessment results, some interesting conclusions with respect to the most vulnerable subassemblies and components in the entire motor system and the potential disadvantage of existing reliability research are finally obtained. It is deemed that these new findings will be of great significance to the future reliability design and maintenance of pure electric vans. © 2013 IEEE.       "

Therefore, insulated conductors are used more and more in overhead power transmission. However, a major challenge of using insulated overhead conductors (IOC) is that the ordinary protection devices are not able to detect the phase-to-ground faults and something, such as tree branch, hitting conductor events. This may cause an accident such as power failure or electrical fire and result in serious damage. In this paper, a new approach, which is based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) for detecting of IOC fault according to partial discharge, is presented. Firstly, the original signal is denoised by DWT. Secondly, the denoised signal is decomposed and extracted features on different layers by DWT. Finally, IOC fault is detected by LSTM.

As a result, there is a growing interest for predictive numerical tools to help assess partial discharge risk. Currently, most efforts rely on Paschen's law as a criterion for partial discharge occurrence between two neighboring wires. Its use requires field lines data obtained with finite element electrostatic simulations. In this paper, we explore the extent to which these finite element simulations can be simplified without losing accuracy regarding subsequent partial discharge risk assessment using Paschen's law. First, we examine whether partial discharge risk predictions between two turns are influenced by the presence of other turns nearby. Our results suggest that the partial discharge is mostly a local phenomenon hardly affected by the surroundings. Performing simulations for an isolated pair of conductors may thus be sufficient to determine the maximum allowable constraints between two turns, at least for large wires. Also, we show that neglecting field line curvature in the calculation does not alter predictions, vindicating the straight line assumption which has been adopted in the literature for the sake of simplicity. © 2013 IEEE.

Random forest sequential forward selection method based on variance analysis (RF-VA) is proposed for the optimal subset selection. This method is improved in two aspects. Firstly, a method based on variance analysis is proposed, which measures feature differences between categories, and obtains a modified arrangement displacement scheme to guide rearrangement of the order of values taken on data sample out of bag. Secondly, the sequence forward search method used to do feature selection could get iteration evaluation results, which solves randomness to determine the size of feature subset and instability of the results existing in the original algorithm.

The nonlinearity of the signal (e.g. voltage) results in the complexity of analyzing the degradation of the battery. Aging characteristics extracted from the voltage, current, and temperature when the battery is fully charged/discharged were commonly used by previous researchers to determine the battery state. The drawbacks of the previous prediction algorithms are insufficient or irrelevant features to explicitly model the battery aging and the use of fully charged/discharged datasets, which might result in poor prediction accuracy. Therefore, this study proposes a feature selection technique to adequately select optimum statistical feature subset and the use of partial charge/discharge data to determine the battery remaining useful life (RUL) using Recurrent Neural Network- Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM).

As latest development on gas analyser, more by-product gases can be detected and used for condition monitoring of the GIS. The type, number, concentration and chemical stability of by-product gases of SF6 GIS are found to be closely correlated to the type of defect. However, the number of by-product gases used increases, the pattern for faults classification become more complex.

In this article, a Hypergraph (HG) based improved Random Forest (RF) algorithm by employing the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm (HG-RF-RFE), has been developed for PD source classification. HG representation of data is considered for obtaining statistical features, which turn out to be a subset of a set of all hyper edges called Hyper statistical features (Helly, Non-Helly, and Isolated hyper edges). HG-RF-RFE takes hyper statistical features and hyper edges as features for classification.

"N. Rosle, et al.",2021,Partial discharges classification methods in xlpe cable: A review,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115519,"Partial discharge (PD) signal classification analysis on cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cables is complex, requiring a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of PD patterns. In the realm of high-voltage electrical insulation, PD pattern characteristics, such as PD charge and inception voltage, are essential as assessment criteria in diagnostics systems using PD classifiers. This paper provides a review of the various PD patterns and classifiers used by previous researchers, specifically for XLPE cables. In addition, the differences of the studies on various sensor developments based on PD detection in the past 27 years are also discussed. The repeatability, recognition accuracy, recognition speed, and effect of feature sizes on each PD classification method are reviewed and explained. This review indicates that the pattern recognition for PD signal using artificial neural network (ANN) exhibits better performance than the other methods in terms of accuracy and repeatability, and the reduction of feature size does not affect the accuracy of ANN. © 2013 IEEE.

Amizhtan, et al.",2022,Impact of DBDS and Silver Sulfide on the Performance of Thermally Aged Mineral oil Impregnated Pressboard Material,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3142960,"The corrosive sulfur compounds present in the mineral oil causes the formation of dibenzyl disulfide (DBDS) complex and it can also erode the on-load tap changing selector contacts leading to generation of silver sulfide (AgS2).The present work reports the effect of DBDS and Ag2S concentrations in mineral oil on thermally aged pressboard material. The results demonstrate that surface discharge inception voltage (SDIV) is higher for the aged pressboard specimen. The higher concentrations of DBDS showed a reduction of more than 50% in the magnitude of SDIV compared to its effect with the addition of Ag2S. The surface potential analysis indicates a higher initial potential for the aged specimens with an increased half lifetime. In addition, only deep traps observed on the aged specimens with a slight right shift in its trap energy level. The mechanical strength of aged pressboard specimens with DBDS and Ag2S is understood using tensile testing and simultaneous analysis is captured using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique to understand its strain percentage at different areas on the pressboard material during its elongation. The laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analysis is performed to identify the elements responsible for thermal ageing such as carbon, copper and sulfur on the surface of pressboard material. The plasma temperature calculated from sulfur peaks is higher for DBDS aged specimen compared to AgS2 and a linear correlation is observed on the LIBS intensity with ageing duration. Further, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for its classification on the degradation of pressboard due to the diffusion of both copper and silver sulfide from the mineral oil. The two principal components (PC1 and PC2) provided a higher variance of 99.8% with a clear classification observed between the unaged and aged pressboard specimens due to the addition of both DBDS and Ag2S in mineral oil.

Leon-Medina, et al.",2022,"Classification of As, Pb and Cd Heavy Metal Ions Using Square Wave Voltammetry, Dimensionality Reduction and Machine Learning",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3143451,"The detection and classification of heavy metals is a growing need to guarantee the quality of process water in different industries. However, the official methodologies to evaluate the presence of these contaminants require samples pre-processing, making them time-consuming and expensive; these elements do not allow online monitoring. For this reason, new technologies are required for online monitoring and evaluation. In this work, a new methodology is presented for the detection and classification of different heavy metal ions such as: As, Pb and Cd. Commercial graphite sensors modified with 2D molybdenite were used applying an electroanalytical technique of square wave voltammetry. Subsequently, signal processing based on pattern recognition and machine learning methods was carried out. This classification methodology includes the following steps: data display and arrangement, dimensionality reduction through the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method, which serves as feature extraction, and the support vector machines (SVM) method as a classifier. The validation is carried out with a data set of 118 aqueous samples. Leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to obtain classification accuracy. The results showed a classification accuracy of 98.31% with only two errors of the experimental validation with this data set. It is concluded that this methodology is a useful tool for detecting the presence of these ions in aqueous samples with MoS2-2D.

Han, et al.",2022,Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearings Using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Packet Transform and Time-Shifted Multiscale Range Entropy,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3180338,"Most existing fault diagnosis methods for rolling bearings are single-stage; these methods can only judge the fault type but cannot detect the existence of a fault. Moreover, the uncertainty in pattern recognition may lead to misclassification of healthy bearings as faulty ones. This paper proposes a multistage fault detection scheme for rolling bearings. In the first stage, the sensitivity of the range entropy to bearing failure is used to define a threshold, based on which the health status of the bearing is judged. If the unknown bearing is judged to be faulty, the next stage is implemented. In the second stage, a fault feature extraction method based on dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform (DTCWPT), time-shifted multiscale range entropy (TSMRE), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is proposed, and a random forest (RF) discriminator is used for fault classification. To achieve the desired performance of fault classification, a new coarsening approach for complexity measurement called TSMRE is developed on the basis of the range entropy (RE). First, the RE value of each time-shifted coarse-grained time series is calculated, and the TSMRE is obtained by averaging the entropy values. The TSMRE improves the coarse-graining processing of the MRE and enhances the stability and reliability of the algorithm. In addition, it can obtain more information from short time series using the time-shifted coarse-grained technology. Therefore, it is less dependent on the length of the original time series. Two sets of rolling bearing data are used for this experiment. The fault recognition rate of each category of samples is 100%. Therefore, the proposed multistage fault diagnosis method can pre-screen healthy bearings and accurately identify the failure types of faulty bearings. © 2013 IEEE.       "
"Z. Huang, et al.",2022,Partial Discharge Diagnosis with Siamese Fusion Network,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3181491,"Partial discharge is a common fault type in the operation of power equipment. Recently, deep learning methods have shown great potential in partial discharge (PD) diagnosis. These methods construct a fitting relationship between input and output with mass training samples. Due to the scarcity of PD samples, it is hard to train a classification model. Thus, it is challenging to apply traditional deep learning methods for diagnosing PD. To overcome this issue, this paper introduces a siamese fusion network to diagnose PD. This method comprises three main steps. First, an ultra-high-frequency (UHF) sensor generates two spectrums from power equipment, including phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) and phase resolved pulse sequence (PRPS). Based on a few-shot learning strategy, a support set is constructed. There are four different types of PD samples and a normal sample. Then, two siamese networks are employed to estimate similarity scores between a test sample and support set samples. One network measures similarity scores in PRPS, and the other measures similarity scores in PRPD. Based on similarity scores, initial diagnosis results are generated. Last, a simple and effective decision fusion technique fuses initial diagnosis results. The final diagnosis result can be generated by jointly exploiting complementary information in two spectrums. With limited training samples, experimental results show that the proposed SFN method can achieve an outstanding diagnosis performance, compared with several classical classification methods. © 2022 IEEE.

The failure of switching or insulation occurs when the pressure rises above a specific level. Characteristics of partial discharge (PD) in VI can be used to measure the internal pressures of VI. This paper defines a classification problem for the degree of internal pressure in VI using PDs, which were measured using a capacitive PD coupler. Then, we propose a deep neural network to monitor the internal pressure of VI by analyzing PDs. Experimental results show that the proposed deep neural network monitors the internal pressure range, from 1.0×10−2 torr to 10 torr in VI.

The stability of nanofluid is of prime concerns, which is achieved by the inclusion of ionic and non-ionic surfactants viz. cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), oleic acid and Span-80. It is observed that CTAB as surfactant has shown discharge resistance property along with high breakdown strength enhancement of up to 39.5% with ester nanofluid. It is observed that fluorescent fiber technique is more sensitive to identify the inception of corona discharge as compared to Ultra high frequency sensor. The permittivity and tan δ of the fluid have shown marginal increase with the addition of surfactants, irrespective of temperature of the fluid. Rheological properties of the liquid showed only Newtonian flow behaviour even upon inclusion of the surfactant. The viscosity of the base fluid and the nanofluids exhibits similar decay rate at higher temperatures. Electrostatic charging tendency (ECT) derives the correlation between rotation speed and the static current measured adopting spinning disc technique. In addition, the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is efficient compared to Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model adopted in predicting the charging tendency incorporating electro-rheological parameters at distinct temperatures.

This study analyzes the appropriateness of interpreting phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) signals using a convolutional neural network (CNN) through the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method. The generated PRPD signals were accumulated by applying AC voltage to four types of electrodes with a polyethylene sheet, followed by their conversion into scattered images to construct a classification model, CNN. The SHAP values for each pixel in the test images were then calculated. The result indicated that the pixels around the 0 V line retained high absolute SHAP values in every label, and the average of the summation of absolute SHAP values over all labels and all test images, which indicates the weight of each pixel, shows a similar tendency. Additionally, insight tests of the two CNN models were conducted, and the results showed that some structural defects could be detected by visualizing the SHAP values for each pixel. Finally, the verification of parameter-and-data vulnerability showed that SHAP has sufficient endurance against some types of instability in the data and model. Although the SHAP method lacks a perfect causal model because of its origin, the results imply that in appropriate use cases, weights on classifications of PD signals could be described by SHAP's interpretability. © 2013 IEEE.

"L. Klein, et al.",2023,Partial Discharge Detection by Edge Computing,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268763,"Edge computing is becoming a mainstream platform for practical applications of machine learning and in particular deep learning. Many systems capable of efficient execution of deep neural models in the context of edge computing are readily available or beginning to appear on the consumer market. The Jetson platform from NVIDIA, the Neural stick from Intel, and the Edge TPU designed by Google are examples of devices that enable the application of complex neural networks in edge computing. This work investigates the ability of selected edge devices to address a real-world classification problem from electrical power engineering. It consists of the detection of partial discharges (PDs) from covered conductors (CCs) on high-voltage power lines. The CCs are used in heavily forested and generally inaccessible areas where clearance zones cannot be maintained. Detection of PDs can prevent forest fires and other disasters potentially caused by prolonged contact of CCs with vegetation. The problem is suitable for an edge computing-based solution because Internet connectivity in remote areas is usually insufficient and a 2G (GSM) mobile network is available at best. Because such locations are difficult to access and usually without a suitable power supply, the proposed solution puts an emphasis also on PD detection latency and the associated power consumption. Two principal approaches to PD detection are considered. One is based on the classification of 1D time series (raw data). The second approach uses the signal transformed into a 2D spectrogram. In this case, two types of algorithms are evaluated. The first one is a novel custom stacking ensemble detector composed of 2D convolutional neural networks and a neural meta-learner on top of it. The second one uses the well-known and widely-used used ResNet deep neural model. © 2013 IEEE.       "

It is of great significance for intelligent operation and maintenance of power cables. In this paper, the PD pulse signal in the 10kV cable joint during accelerated electrical aging under 20kV AC voltage was acquired in the real-time for about 160h. The characteristic parameters of partial discharge-pulse number, average voltage, maximum voltage and energy per second were extracted. The results show that the phase of partial discharge is mainly concentrated at 30°-90° and 200°-270°, which can be characterized as internal discharge. PD characteristic parameters gradually increased after 50h. The pulse number, energy per second and the average voltage of PD pulse reached a peak between 60-80h. Then these parameters reached a steady state between 80-130h and showed a steep rise after 130h. The maximum voltage of PD pulse shows a steep rise at about 70h from 0.1V to 0.3V. It rises sharply from 0.3V to 0.5V after about 120h and then enters a relatively stable oscillation stage. The evolution rules of the PD characteristic parameters comply well with the electrical tree growth states-initiation period, lag period and rapid growth period. Furthermore, model for predicting and evaluating the insulation state based on BP neural network are established and the prediction accuracy is verified.

In this paper, considering the flashover characteristics of insulator strings in complex environments, noise is added to the collected insulator strings to simulate the actual complex environment, and then the collected data are rotationally transformed and filtered using an improved non-local mean filtering algorithm. To accurately locate insulator strings in complex environments, the geodesic active contour correction algorithm is employed to locate and segment the image. This algorithm is developed based on the level set model, replaces the image target boundary finding problem with the problem of solving a weighted arc length minimum, and introduces a penalty term into the level set energy generalization that constrains the distance function of the level set, which effectively solves the edge leakage problem. For the segmented image of insulator strings, grayscale features and wavelet features are extracted, and then the optimized random forest algorithm is utilized for prediction analysis, and the diversity of weak learners in the random forest algorithm is increased not only through sample perturbation but also through attribute perturbation, leading to excellent generalization performance. Additionally, by combining the misclassification matrix and the a priori probability optimization algorithm, the random forest algorithm is optimized to achieve a better classification effect.

Lei, et al.",2019,Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis via Joint Learning from Multiple Modalities and Relations,10.1109/JBHI.2018.2868420,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative progressive disease that mainly affects the motor systems of patients. To slow this disease deterioration, early and accurate diagnosis of PD is an effective way, which alleviates mental and physical sufferings by clinical intervention. In this paper, we propose a joint regression and classification framework for PD diagnosis via magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging data. Specifically, we devise a unified multitask feature selection model to explore multiple relationships among features, samples, and clinical scores. We regress four clinical variables of depression, sleep, olfaction, cognition scores, as well as perform the classification of PD disease from the multimodal data. The multitask model explores the relationships at the level of clinical scores, image features, and subjects, to select the most informative and diseased-related features for diagnosis. The proposed method is evaluated on the public Parkinson's progression markers initiative dataset. The extensive experimental results show that the multitask framework can effectively boost the performance of regression and classification and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The computerized predictions of clinical scores and label for PD diagnosis may offer quantitative reference for decision support as well. © 2013 IEEE.       "

Liuzzi, et al.",2023,The Consciousness Domain Index: External Validation and Prognostic Relevance of a Data-Driven Assessment,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3264987,"The prognosis of neurological outcomes in patients with prolonged Disorders of Consciousness (pDoC) has improved in the last decades. Currently, the level of consciousness at admission to post-acute rehabilitation is diagnosed by the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and this assessment is also part of the used prognostic markers. The consciousness disorder diagnosis is based on scores of single CRS-R sub-scales, each of which can independently assign or not a specific level of consciousness to a patient in a univariate fashion. In this work, a multidomain indicator of consciousness based on CRS-R sub-scales, the Consciousness-Domain-Index (CDI), was derived by unsupervised learning techniques. The CDI was computed and internally validated on one dataset (N=190) and then externally validated on another dataset (N=86). Then, the CDI effectiveness as a short-term prognostic marker was assessed by supervised Elastic-Net logistic regression. The prediction accuracy of the neurological prognosis was compared with models trained on the level of consciousness at admission based on clinical state assessments. CDI-based prediction of emergence from a pDoC improved the clinical assessment-based one by 5.3% and 3.7%, respectively for the two datasets. This result confirms that the data-driven assessment of consciousness levels based on multidimensional scoring of the CRS-R sub-scales improve short-term neurological prognosis with respect to the classical univariately-derived level of consciousness at admission. © 2013 IEEE.

Most of the electrical faults leading to arc are developed slowly, e.g., due to insulation degradation or bad connection. In this paper, the detection of partial discharges (PDs) and low energy arcing between loose contacts has been proposed for online monitoring of MV switchgear. The PD measurements in a switchgear panel and arcing measurements across a 0.2-mm sphere-to-rod gap have been carried out. Measured signals are captured by a differential electric field sensor (D-dot sensor) and recorded by a high-frequency oscilloscope. In general, online measured signals are suppressed by high-frequency noise, and therefore, de-noising of measurements is of paramount importance to get reliable information about a fault. An implementation of discrete wavelet transform, to de-noise the measured signals, has been proposed in this paper. Comparison with a well-known infinite impulse response filtering technique has been made. Time and frequency domain comparisons between original and de-noised signals reveal the significance of this technique for arc fault prediction in MV switchgear.

Gulati, et al.",2016,Appliance activity recognition using radio frequency interference emissions,10.1109/JSEN.2016.2578937,"Over the past few decades, with rapid growth in infrastructure, there has been tremendous growth in energy consumption. Along with this, more and more electronic appliances are added to the existing infrastructure every day. Furthermore, the existing energy bills just provide an aggregate number of units consumed but fail to provide any actionable details of appliance level usage. With the quest for long-term energy sustainability and to reduce this ever-growing energy consumption, research groups across the globe have started looking into energy disaggregation as a means of providing feedback. Some promising techniques such as non-intrusive appliance load monitoring have been adopted to provide detailed energy breakdown to the end consumer. Despite all these efforts, energy attribution to the electrical activities still seems to be a farfetched goal, especially in shared spaces. In this paper, we have analyzed the possibility of using radio frequency (RF) emissions from electronic appliances to detect electrical activity. Besides their known operation, these appliances are known to radiate high-frequency noise in the ambient environment, also called RF interference (RFI). Hence, by utilizing these RFI emissions from electronic appliances, electrical activity from the appliance can be detected in multiple frequency bands and at varying distances. An eight-fit Gaussian mixture model and $k$ -peak finder are used for feature extraction from RFI data, followed by appliance activity recognition using $k$ -nearest neighbor-based classification. Appliance detection is performed with a mean accuracy of 71.9% across seven-class classification problem. Finally, the characteristic features of RFI observed from these appliances are discussed. © 2001-2012 IEEE.       "

The first clinical symptoms can manifest themselves long before the retirement age and inevitably lead to reducing the possibility of continuing work. However, PD is sometimes misdiagnosed. In this article, we discuss the typical misdiagnosed cases and propose a second opinion system based on wearable sensors and artificial intelligence. For this reason, we designed a number of common tasks and recorded the movement data using wearable sensors worn by individuals with PD and other extrapyramidal disorders. PD patients are differentiated against other patients with similar diseases and not against healthy subjects. This allows one to measure the true specificity of wearable technologies with regard to detecting PD. Data analysis and classification of the types of tremor using machine learning methods (feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, classification) helps significantly improve the accuracy of PD diagnosis. Our results show that, when considering bradykinesia and tremor together, the accuracy of distinguishing PD from similar diseases increases (f1 score 0.88).

Horizontal visibility graph (HVG) converts a time series into an undirected graphical network while preserving its temporal characteristics. In the present contribution, PD signals of single and multiple void discharges were measured using a high frequency current transformer (HFCT) sensor and subsequently transformed to undirected graphical networks using HVG. From the HVG of the PD signals, several spectral graph features were extracted for recognition of PD signals. The extracted features were further subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to examine their statistical significance and followed by FDR correction to select the most discriminative features. The PD signals were classified using three machine learning classifiers. We also investigated the performance of our method by varying penetrable distance-an important parameter of HVG for robust detection of PD signals in presence of noise. Investigations revealed that very high recognition accuracy has been obtained in discriminating different PD signals using HVGSA. Interestingly, we also observed that in the presence of noise, detection accuracy can be improved significantly by increasing the penetrable distance within a permissible range. Finally, an optimum value of penetrable distance parameter has been determined for accurate recognition of PD signals at different noise levels. The proposed technique can be applied for real-life PD signal detection for insulation condition monitoring. © 2001-2012 IEEE.       "

The notch filtering is used to mitigate narrowband RFI energy, while the linear prediction is introduced to recover the missing range spectral component of the SAR raw data from the desired scene, which is removed together with RFI sources by the notch filter. Because of the Gibbs phenomenon in Fourier series, the small residual RFI energy after notch filtering is enough to cause image visual disturbances and affect the accuracy of the following missing range spectrum extrapolation.

The deep learning methods are supervised and difficult to obtain satisfactory performance when the number of labeled samples is insufficient.

However, in this article, an UHF approach is presented. The UHF method was first introduced on gas-insulated switchgear but is also applicable to power transformers [2]. In the technique, an antenna is inserted into the transformer tank through an oil valve. The method detects PD by measuring electromagnetic emissions originating from transient currents of PD [3], [4]. Because the tank is grounded, it represents a Faraday cage shielding external noise, which makes the UHF method less sensitive to external PD such as corona. Compared to electrical PD measurements, the UHF method has to be treated differently. Unlike electrical PD measurements, UHF measurements cannot be calibrated in terms of apparent charge in picocoulombs because the strength of the electromagnetic field is measured. However, like electrical measurements, it is possible to correlate PD to the phase angle of the applied voltage using the phase-resolved PD (PRPD) pattern. This article presents an overview of UHF PD measurements of a generator step-up transformer over a three-year period. Several PD sources are active in the transformer, and fast changes in the PD pattern and levels are observed. An approach for the evaluation of measurement data is introduced, and the long-term development of PD is discussed in the article. The aim is to discriminate different PD sources from the PRPD pattern and classify them in terms of their level and frequency of occurrence on a long-term basis.

"Z. Wang, et al.",2013,Gas generation in natural ester and mineral oil under partial discharge and sparking faults,10.1109/MEI.2013.6585858,"Mineral oil has been widely used in power transformers for more than a century because of its excellent dielectric and thermal characteristics. However, it is nonbiodegradable and could cause serious environmental problems if leakages or spills occurred. With increasingly strict environment rules and regulations, esters are sometimes used instead of mineral oil in transformers rated up to 245 kV [1]. Esters have different molecular structures than do mineral oils and thus different physical, dielectric, and chemical properties. They also have higher viscosities, and so higher temperatures are required for the impregnation of cellulose insulation [2]; higher viscosity also lowers cooling efficiency and increases the operating temperature of the transformer [3]. Esters are more hygroscopic than mineral oil and thus have higher absolute water content (ppm); their dielectric strength decreases with increasing relative humidity in a way similar to mineral oil [4]. In a quasi-uniform electric field, esters generally show breakdown strengths comparable to those of mineral oils. In a divergent field, discharges in the esters propagate faster and further than in mineral oils at the same voltage level, and hence the esters exhibit higher partial discharge (PD) repetition rates under AC stress [5], [6] and lower lightning impulse breakdown voltages, especially at large gaps [7], [8]. Accordingly, the design and operation of ester-filled power transformers need to be carefully considered. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a common technique used to diagnose incipient faults in mineral-oil-filled transformers [9]-[11]. Before the introduction of online monitors, DGA involved periodic oil sampling followed by laboratory analysis of the gas components dissolved in the oil. In the past decade, an increasing number of multi-gas online monitors have become commercially available, enabling almost continuous monitoring of gassing in service [12]. In recent years, some studies of fault gas generation in esters have been reported [13]-[21]. It was found that, under thermal faults, the fault gases generated in esters are similar to those generated in mineral oils, although the molecular structures of esters are different [13]. The generation rate of dissolved gases in natural esters is slightly lower than in mineral oils, and natural esters are particularly stable under medium-temperature thermal faults [14], [22]. Ethane is generated in natural esters if exposed to oxygen under normal operating temperatures (<140°C) [23]; under thermal faults up to 600°C, ethane and carbon oxides account for more than 70% of fault gas generation [15], [22]. When subjected to PD, esters generate a higher level of dissolved gases (mostly hydrogen) than do mineral oils [18]. Under breakdown, similar concentrations of dissolved fault gases (mainly acetylene) are generated in esters and in mineral oils [16]. The interpretation of DGA data for esters needs to be improved, particularly the classification boundaries between medium-temperature and high-temperature thermal faults, and between low-energy and high-energy discharges [13], [20]. © 2006 IEEE.

E.

This refers in particular to the measurement of partial discharges (PD) in compliance with the international standard IEC 60270 [1], [2]. As PD events in gaseous cavities embedded in the bulk dielectric of HV equipment are the most harmful ones, the mechanism of such internal discharges should be well known to judge the PD severity as well as to specify appropriate procedures and quantities for PD tests under direct voltage. According to Devins cavity discharges can be classified as ""Townsendlike discharges"" and ""streamer-like discharges"" [3]. Even if this classification seems to be reasonable for cavity discharges under both alternating and direct voltage [4]-[6], this has been rejected by Bartnikas. So, he argued in [7] that ""the term 'streamer' by itself, when applied to PD in relatively short gaps or small cavity diameters, introduces unnecessarily a misleading term in the PD lexicon. PD, when occurring in short gaps, may assume different forms: rapid and slow rise time spark-type pulses."" This is also consistent with the worldwide established PD model according to Kreuger [8], which is based on the hypothesis that the virtual cavity capacitance is discharged via a conductive spark channel. Despite simplicity, this concept was rejected by Pedersen and his coworkers [9], [10]. As an alternative, they promoted a more sophisticated field-theoretical approach based on a dipole model. As their concept is not easily understandable, this was presented in a more simplified manner in this Magazine [11], [12] as well as in [13]. © 2016 IEEE.       "

Strachan, et al.",2008,Knowledge-based diagnosis of partial discharges in power transformers,10.1109/T-DEI.2008.4446759,"The abstraction of meaningful diagnostic information from raw condition monitoring data in domains where diagnostic expertise and knowledge is limited and constantly evolving presents a significant research challenge. Expert diagnosis and location of partial discharges in High Voltage electrical plant is one such domain. This paper describes the functionality of a knowledge-based decision support system capable of providing engineers with a comprehensive diagnosis of the defects responsible for partial discharge activity detected in oil-filled power transformers. Plant data captured from partial discharge (PD) sensors can be processed to generate phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns. This paper proposes a means of abstracting the salient features characterizing the observed PRPD patterns. Captured knowledge describing the visual interpretation of these patterns can be applied for defect diagnosis and location. The knowledge-based PRPD pattern interpretation system can support on-line plant condition assessment and defect diagnosis by presenting a comprehensive diagnosis of PD activity detected and classification of the defect source. The paper also discusses how the system justifies its diagnosis of the PD activity to offer the expert greater confidence in the result, a feature generally absent in 'black-box' pattern recognition techniques. The incremental approach exhibited by the system reflects that of a PD expert's visual interpretation of the PRPD pattern. The paper describes how this functional system design has evolved from the approach taken by PD experts to the visual interpretation of PRPD patterns. © 2008 IEEE.       "

The design achieves a good input impedance match and linear phase of S11 throughout the passband (1.5-20 GHz and -5 dB criterion for impedance bandwidth). But some occasional slight mismatch and small phase distortion occurs at low frequencies. Four different experimental results are shown and the measured gain is generally > 4 dBi. For better insight, The S11 performance and input impedance of the proposed antenna are compared with those of the conventional PGK monopole antenna. For analyzing the time-domain characteristics of the antenna, the proposed antenna is assumed to be excited by the three wideband signals corresponding to 1.5-3, 6.0-12, and 13.5-20 GHz which means this antenna can be used as multiband antenna in time domain applications. However, each band consists of wide range of frequency. These bands are selected to examine the time domain response of proposed antennas. For insurability the proposed antenna can be used in pulse communications systems, the correlation between the time-domain transmitting antenna input signal and the receiving antenna output signal is calculated. This antenna is suitable for applications in ICMS, DECT, UMTS, Bluetooth, and WLAN systems. Because of linear phase and good impedance match, with some further optimization and manufacturing aspect, this antenna can serve in UWB applications. © 2008 IEEE.       "

Seo, et al.",2012,Identification of insulation defects in cryogenic dielectric materials for the HTS power applications,10.1109/TASC.2011.2178991,"Recently, various high temperature superconducting (HTS) power applications have been developed and prepared for field tests and commercial applications. Comparing to conventional power applications, it could offer several advantages such as reduced size and weight, high efficiency, decreased losses, no oil, nonflammable and decrease of CO 2 emissions. Besides overload operation is possible with no loss of lifetime. For HTS power applications in low temperature and high voltage environments, partial discharge (PD) measurements in cryogenic dielectric materials of HTS power applications are very important because PD was regarded as primary source for ageing and breakdown of cryogenic materials. One of the diagnostic methods for safety of the power components, the detection of PD taking place inside the apparatus has been widely investigated. The first method, phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) Analysis was developed in the early 1970s taking the phase information of the applied AC voltage into account. We also proposed a pattern analysis method named chaotic analysis of PD(CAPD) for PDs occurred in liquid nitrogen, considering three normalized parameters obtained from the values between two consecutive PD pulses: amplitude difference(P t), occurring time difference (T t) and correlation between T t and P t. This pattern analysis method can identify the type of defects by means of PD pattern classification without employing the phase information of the applied voltage signal. For the experimental investigation, three artificial defects have been fabricated considering possible defects formed during the manufacturing process of HTS power applications: turn to turn insulation, floating particle and protrusion. And PD signals originated from these artificial defects are measured and analyzed by means of CAPD. Throughout this work, it seems that the correlation between the consecutive PD pulses, depending on the nature PDs, could be clarified by CAPD. © 2011 IEEE.       "

Random vector functional link network (RVFL) has shown its effectiveness for classification task, while its extended version, namely RVFL plus (RVFL+), integrates the additional privileged information (PI) about training samples in RVFL to help training a more effective classifier. On the other hand, it is still a popular way to adopt only a single neuroimaging modality for PD diagnosis in a clinical practice. In this work, we construct a novel cascaded multi-column RVFL+ (cmcRVFL+) framework for the single-modal neuroimaging-based PD diagnosis without the additional neuroimaging modality as PI. Specifically, the predicted values of RVFL+ classifiers in the current layers are used as the PI for the following classifiers, and therefore, the PI features are self-generated without additional modality. Furthermore, only the multi-column RVFL+ classifiers in the last layer of cmcRVFL+ are finally ensembled to generate the predictive result in the test stage. The experimental results on both the transcranial sonography data set and the magnetic resonance imaging data set for PD show that the proposed cmcRVFL+ algorithm achieves superior performance to all the compared algorithms. It suggests that the proposed cmcRVFL+ has the potential to be flexibly applied to various single-modal imaging based CAD. © 1964-2012 IEEE.       "

Focus is made on a new measuring system for the digital acquisition of PD-pulse signals, which operates at a sampling rate high enough to avoid the frequency aliasing, but that provides an amount of PD pulses which enables PD stochastic analysis. A separation and classification method, based on a fuzzy classifier, is developed for the analysis of the acquired PD-pulse shape signals. The result of the fuzzy classification is a cluster of signals homogeneous in terms of stochastic features of PD pulses. The classification efficiency is evaluated resorting to the PD-pulse height and phase distributions analysis. The instrumentation, and the associated classification methodology, are applied to measure and analyze PD data recorded for mica-insulated stator bars and coils, where typical defects, occurring during normal operations, were simulated. It is shown that the proposed procedure enables PD-source identification to solve the identification problems which arise, in particular, when different sources of PD are simultaneously active. In addition fuzzy classification provides an efficient noise-rejection tool.       "

The data collected during the test is generally represented as distributions. These distributions are interpreted to reveal the PD phenomenon and the state of the insulation. The paper demonstrates the effect of instrument characteristics on measurement and representation of PD phenomenon with experimental results obtained from short time PD endurance tests on oil pressboard samples. The instrumentation, a combined narrowband detector and multi-channel analyzer (MCA), is analyzed for the effect of the detector resolution and gain settings on the PD distributions. The results show the instrument dependence in the PD characteristics due to differences in measurement ability at various instrument settings. These differences in representation lead to multiple interpretation for the same phenomenon or state of the insulation and hence to wrong classification.

In the training phase, a decision tree is developed to relate the pulse shape with the cavity size by using inductive machine learning. The C4.5 machine learning algorithm is deployed to realize the tree using the training data, since it has the capability of inferring the rules and to produce the tree in terms of continuous features. During testing, the cavity size is recognized by means of the rules extracted from the decision tree.

The authors have previously demonstrated that a carbon nanotube (CNT) gas sensor could detect partial discharge (PD) generated in SF6 gas. However, PD-generated decomposition gas species, which were responsible for the CNT gas sensor response, have not been identified yet. In this paper, two kinds of experiments were conducted in order to identify the responsible decomposition gas species. At first, the decomposition gas molecules adsorbed on CNTs were analyzed by Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. FTIR absorbance was observed around 735 cm-1 after CNTs were exposed to PD generated in SF6. In the second experiment, the CNT gas sensor responses to typical SF6 decomposition products (HF and SF4) were examined. The CNT gas sensor responded to these gases in the same way as to PD generated in SF6. SF4 response was larger than HF response. Based on these results, SF4 and SOF2 emerged as candidates for the responsible decomposition gases. Electrochemical interactions between adsorbed gas molecules and CNT were discussed based on theoretical predictions of molecular orbital calculations. The calculation results suggested that both of SOF2 and SF4 could increase the CNT gas sensor conductance. © 2006 IEEE.       "

This paper deals with PD signals obtained by remote radiometric measurements performed on a power transformer. Extensive PD measurements were performed in the substation. Since fingerprints of the remote radiometric measurements are not available, the formation of clusters with similar features obtained from captured PD data is crucial. A data mining technique known as Self-organizing Map (SOM) for the analysis and interpretation of captured PD data is used. Since each signal contains a large number of samples, before applying the SOM, the dimensionality reduction based on principal component analysis is performed.

A variety of methods exist to capture the signals that are emitted during PD, and this paper focuses on the ultra high frequency (UHF) and IEC 60270 techniques. Phase-resolved patterns can be constructed from the PD data captured using either of these techniques and due to the individual signatures that different defects generate, experts can examine the phase-resolved pattern to classify the defect that created it. In recent years, knowledge regarding PD phenomena and phase-resolved patterns has increased, providing an opportunity to employ a knowledge-based system (KBS) to automate defect classification. Due to the consistent physical nature of PD across different high voltage apparatus and the ability to construct phase-resolved patterns from various sensors, the KBS offers a generic approach to the analysis of PD by taking the phase-resolved pattern as its input and identifying the physical PD processes associate with the pattern. This paper describes the advances of this KBS, highlighting its generic application through the use of several case studies, which present the diagnosis of defects captured through both the IEC 60270 and UHF techniques.

The monitoring methodology uses different ANNs in order to predict the appearance of the white arc based on the identification, classification and analysis of the occurrence frequency of electric discharges. The results show that the ANN monitoring model developed is able to predict the onset of permanent regime under various experimental conditions. Hence, it was found that the delay between the permanent regime onset prediction delivered by the ANN model and its realization is 9 minutes on average.

Jacob, et al.",2012,On-line monitoring of partial discharges in a HVDC station environment,10.1109/TDEI.2012.6215096,"This paper deals with the on-line measurement of partial discharges (PD) in a high voltage direct current (HVDC) converter station. The HVDC station is a particularly challenging environment for measurement due to elevated interference levels caused from the switching of thyristor-controlled converters. In this work, online PD measurements were performed on two specimens; one is an HVDC converter transformer and the other an HVDC converter wall bushing. The measurements were performed in the high-frequency range from 400 kHz to 30 MHz with modern wideband PD measurement instrumentation. Results demonstrate that on-line measurement of PD in an HVDC station environment is possible and that a combination of input filtering and modern signal processing methods for feature extraction can be used to mitigate the converter interference. The feature extraction method used plots partial discharge data on a time-frequency classification map. The map enabled isolation of individual PD phenomena, and demonstrated that trending to monitor insulation degradation is possible with online partial discharge measurement. Furthermore, specific strategies for PD measurement and analysis are developed for each of the transformer and bushing specimens. © 2012 IEEE.       "

Ibrahim, et al.",2012,Realization of partial discharge signals in transformer oils utilizing advanced computational techniques,10.1109/TDEI.2012.6396955,"The measurement of acoustic and electrical signals for the partial discharge (PD) activity due to the presence of metallic particles within transformer oil are utilized for the characterization of the incipient hazards. The utilization of phase resolved, in addition, to time resolved partial discharge signals is undertaken to extract numerous features using statistical and frequency analyzers. The extracted features are down scaled to pinpoint the effective attributes that render an intelligent classification means useful for determining contaminating particle type and dimensions. This is accomplished by utilizing feature selection wrapper models undertaking the sequential floating forward selection (SFFS) and particle swarm optimization as alternative search strategies. Support vector machines (SVM) is finally used for the classification of contaminating particles identity. A comprehensive comparison between various selection techniques of the best feature vector for the most efficient classification is tackled based on size of selected feature vector, processing time and success of classification. Results of this study can be integrated into a smart automatable tool based on recent data mining techniques that would provide an efficient and prompt identification for the nature of incipient hazards due to lack in insulation integrity. © 1994-2012 IEEE.

This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying pattern recognition techniques to automatic PD source classification. Three challenging issues are investigated in this paper. The first issue is the feature extraction for obtaining representative attributes from the original PD measurement data. Several approaches including stochastic neighbour embedding (SNE), principle component analysis (PCA), kernel principle component analysis (KPCA), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and conventional statistic operators are adopted for feature extraction. The second issue is the pattern recognition algorithms for identifying various types of PD sources. A novel fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) and a variety of artificial neural networks (ANNs) are applied in the paper. The third issue is the identification of multiple PD sources, which may occur in HV equipment simultaneously. Two approaches are proposed to address this issue. To evaluate the performance of various algorithms in this paper, extensive laboratory experiments on a number of artificial PD models are conducted. The classification results reveal that FSVM significantly outperforms a number of ANN algorithms. The practical PD sources classification for HV equipment is a considerable complicated problem.

Robles, et al.",2013,Shielding effect of power transformers tanks in the ultra-high-frequency detection of partial discharges,10.1109/TDEI.2013.6508772,"Partial discharges (PD) measurement is a well-known technique for judgment of the condition of power transformer offline. Phase-resolved PD measurement is a normalized technique for PD tests, but noise, especially by PD-measurements onsite is sometimes difficult to reject, and a post-processing of a pattern is necessary to separate different sources. Higher-frequency-detection devices and processing strategies are useful for PD classification and identification. Recently, ultra-high-frequency (UHF) detection by means of antennas has been shown to be a promising detection system for both offline and online PD-measurements. However, it is necessary to assess whether PD source separation and classification is possible by means of pulse analysis because some additional UHF noise sources are coupled to the detected signals, and it is not clear whether different sources produce different pulses. In this study, the attenuation effect of the metallic tank of a power transformer on the inner PD activity when measured outside the tank was studied. Additionally, experiments were conducted to detect and characterize two different PD sources (internal and external discharges) using two antennas measuring the same phenomenon inside and outside of a transformer. It will also be shown that broadband UHF signals are useful for PD recognition and that a deep study of frequencies below 500 MHz can separate PD occurring inside from those occurring outside when measured with an antenna outside the tank. © 1994-2012 IEEE.

The proposed decision tree based algorithm has well kept its capability in classifying the void size under different conditions of geometrical properties of the void such as size, depth and location; cable characteristics such as age and temperature; and also environmental noise. The procedure includes four stages which are, signal de-noising, PD detection, feature generation and compensation and finally void classification. In the first stage, the prerequisite task of de-noising is performed by a filter based on Mathematical Morphology (MM). PD detection stage is carried out based on mathematical morphology functions, too. In the feature generation stage, a compensation procedure is employed, in order to diminish the effect of pulse propagation along the cable on the PD features used for classification.

In this process, first a knowledge basis is developed through construction of 4 different types of PD models in the high voltage laboratory. Background noise is considered as one class in this knowledge basis. The high frequency time domain current signals of high voltage equipment are captured over one power frequency cycle. The single PD activities within this captured signal are extracted by application of a threshold-based method. Four popular feature extraction methods i.e. Statistical, texture, FFT and Cepstral features are applied on these recorded extracted PD signals. To distinguish the different PD types, three conceptually different classifier types, Neural Network, Decision Tree, and k-nearest neighbours, are applied on the recorded feature spaces. Using Bayesian theory, a performance analysis is carried out to find whether the classifiers are over-fitted or not. Although, the most reliable data mining tool found to be a combination of a Cepstral feature space, and neural network classifier however, since the statistical features can be computed very fast it is employed in this work. Next, it is proposed to use a cascade PD identifier to find whether the detected signal is noise or not.

Traditional connector of two GIS tanks is a disc insulator, so the leakage of PD signal is easily detected. Recently, to improve the performance of GIS, the disc insulator is often sealed by a metal belt and an aperture is made in the metal belt for PD detection. The leakage of PD is weak and the PD detection is delicate. This paper is devoted to the theoretical and experimental study of the transmission and leakage characteristics of the PD signals in such GIS. The electric field in the GIS and the characteristics of the leaked signals are simulated with software Ansoft HFSS. The PD source is assimilated by two simple models: ""line feed"" and ""waveguide feed"". The simulation results show that the frequency band and amplitude of the leaked signals depend on the size of the aperture and the distance of the detector from the GIS. A novel ultra wideband planar antenna is developed and a full experiment setup is built to validate the simulation and to test the characteristics of the leaked PD signal. The transmission coefficient S21 has been measured with a vector network analyzer. The experimental results correspond better to the simulation data with ""line feed"" than ""waveguide feed"". But the prediction of the frequency characteristics by the dipole model is very different from the experiment results in the high frequency domain. Furthermore, we show by the experiments that the amplitude and frequency profile of the transmission coefficient S21 is sensible to the position of the PD source in the GIS. © 1994-2012 IEEE.       "

UHF PD signals of four typical GIS discharge models that were collected in a laboratory were analyzed. In addition, the multifractal feature of these signals was investigated. The single-scale shortcoming of traditional detrended fluctuation analysis and its sensitivity to interference information trends were overcame. Thus, the proposed method was able to effectively characterized the multi-scaling behavior and nonlinear characteristics of UHF PD signals. With the use of the shape and distribution difference of the multifractal spectrum, seven feature parameters with clear physical meanings were extracted as feature quantity for pattern recognition and input to the support vector machine for classification. Results showed that the feature extraction method based on MFDFA could effectively identify four kinds of insulation defects even with strong background noise.

When on-line tests are performed in noisy environments, or when more than one source of pulse-shaped signals are present in a cable system, it is difficult to perform accurate diagnoses. In these cases, an adequate selection of the non-conventional measuring technique and the implementation of effective signal processing tools are essential for a correct evaluation of the insulation degradation. Once a specific noise rejection filter is applied, many signals can be identified as potential PD pulses, therefore, a classification tool to discriminate the PD sources involved is required. This paper proposes an efficient method for the classification of PD signals and pulse-Type noise interferences measured in power cables with HFCT sensors. By using a signal feature generation algorithm, representative parameters associated to the waveform of each pulse acquired are calculated so that they can be separated in different clusters. The efficiency of the clustering technique proposed is demonstrated through an example with three different PD sources and several pulse-shaped interferences measured simultaneously in a cable system with a high frequency current transformer (HFCT). © 1994-2012 IEEE.

The experiments were carried out in a cold climate room of CIGELE Laboratories according to the methods recommended by IEEE Std. 1783/2009. The maximum withstand voltage (VMW = 81 kVrms) and minimum flashover voltage (VMF = 84 kVrms) were obtained to reflect electrical performance of suspension insulators under a most dangerous ice type. The ice accretion process, the length, width and number of icicles associated with the appearance of partial discharges were observed and discussed to present the final formation of a relatively uniform ice layer and vertical icicles along the insulator string. This ice-covered insulator string was characterized by air gaps on the grounded-side shed space and complete ice bridging of the other shed spaces, which have significant influence on the development of arcing discharges leading to flashover. Nonlinear characteristics of LC were analyzed by using a recurrent plot (RP) technique, which graphically gives nonlinear variations of LC on RP maps as well as nonlinear indicators for quantitative prediction of the flashover. The obtained results reveal that dynamic behavior (initiation, propagation, extinguishment and re-ignition) of arcing discharges on ice-covered suspension insulators can be visually reflected by the texture transition of RP maps of LC, which correlate with different stages during the flashover process. The quantitative indicators including a recurrence rate (RR) value lower than 0.24 and a deterministic (DET) value lower than 0.965 are proposed as the predictive values to indicate the highest probability of flashover occurrence. The results obtained will be helpful to predict most hazards of ice-covered outdoor insulators; this is one of monitoring methods based on LC characteristic analysis. © 2015 IEEE.       "

Thus, it is important for the detection and classification of PD signals to initially suppress the noise encountered with PD measurement. In this paper, we investigate a method, named power spectral subtraction denoising (PSSD) that uses fast Fourier transform to restrain the random noise encountered in measured acoustic PD signals. The denoising performance of PSSD is compared with those of wavelet-based denoising techniques in addition to the mathematical morphological filter. The denoising techniques are first examined on PD signals contaminated with low and high levels of simulated random noise. The denoising evaluation metrics show the superiority of PSSD over the other techniques. Moreover, a modified PSSD (M-PSSD) method is presented to address the actual PD signals corrupted with real random noise. High reduction in noise levels are achieved using M-PSSD. © 2016 IEEE.

This method was developed by using data on service-aged stator bars from generators as well as accelerated aging model bars. Thermal aging, mechanical aging, and combined thermal and mechanical aging were done individually as accelerated aging. The partial discharge characteristics, dissipation factor, and breakdown voltage were measured on the model bars and service-aged bars from generators. From these results, the residual breakdown electrical field strength was predicted based on the partial discharge characteristics and dissipation factor. First, the dominant type of deterioration (thermal or mechanical aging) on a bar's insulation was determined by the pattern of voltage-partial discharge magnitude characteristics. Then the residual breakdown electrical field strength was predicted by using a predicting equation for both thermal and mechanical aging. Each predicting equation uses dissipation factor tip-up (i.e. difference in dissipation factor values between 2 kV and rated voltage) and partial discharge inception electrical field strength. The accuracy of this method was confirmed using data measured on 112 service-aged stator bars from generators and 10 accelerated aged model bars.

Boya, et al.",2015,Identification of multiple partial discharge sources using acoustic emission technique and blind source separation,10.1109/TDEI.2015.7116363,"The goal of an automatic monitoring system of partial discharges (PDs), based on acoustic emission (AE) detection, is the identification of the type of source of PD and its localization. In the event that multiple deterioration processes are present in the electrical equipment, more than one PD source may be active and their AE signals may overlap on the sensors. This overlapping effect modifies the temporal and frequency characteristics of the measured signals compared to the characteristics of the signals from a single PD source and thus, automatic classification becomes very difficult. In this paper we have proposed applying blind signal separation (BSS) techniques to recover the signals from each source, therefore separating each temporal and frequency characteristic. We have tested the proposed algorithm: firstly using synthetic mixed signals from two types of PD sources and secondly using real signals from a test bench specifically designed to control the position, time and amplitude of the AEs.

Four types of PDs are considered for the multi-class classification problem, namely; PD from a sharp point to ground plane, surface discharge, PD from a void in the insulation, and PD from semi parallel planes. The collected AE signals are processed using pattern classification techniques to identify their corresponding PD types. The measurement conditions include the influences of various PD locations, oil temperatures, and having a barrier in the line-of-sight between the PD source and the AE sensor. A recognition rate of 94% is achieved when classifying the different PD types measured at the same conditions. In addition, it has been found that the different PD source locations, oil temperatures, and barrier insertion have an impact on the recognition rate. However, by including AE samples at these different conditions in the training process, a recognition rate around 90% for all cases is achieved.       "

Biswas, et al.",2016,Cross-spectrum analysis based methodology for discrimination and localization of partial discharge sources using acoustic sensors,10.1109/TDEI.2016.005616,"In this paper, a scheme has been developed for detecting individual, as well as multiple partial discharge (PD) sources within a transformer tank through acoustic sensors. For that purpose, in the laboratory, a transformer tank has been emulated inside which, provisions are made to place artificially created partial discharge sources at different locations. An experimental setup has been prepared to record the acoustic PD signal through multiple acoustic sensors placed at the outside surfaces of the walls. Presented results show the signature of the acquired data pattern for both individual and multiple discharges. Acoustic PD detection method experiences difficulty in locating the PD source accurately due to interference or attenuation of signals from the environmental noise. It is seen that Cross-wavelet transform (XWT) has an ability to nullify the effect of random noises present in the acquired acoustic PD signal. Thus, cross-wavelet transform based feature extraction with ensemble binary support vector machine based classifier is used for locating the partial discharge sources within the tank. These methodologies have been chosen as they suit well to discriminate between the PD sources at different locations inside the tank. Results indicate that the average classification accuracy is 92.8%. The contribution of this research work is in discriminating individual as well as multiple partial discharge sources which produce acoustic emission simultaneously. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methodology can be used to localize partial discharge sources in high voltage apparatus where the acoustic signals due to partial discharges find a path to propagate towards the outer surface. © 2016 IEEE.

Partial discharge (PD) analysis is a vital tool for assessing the insulation quality in cable joints. Although many works have been done on PD pattern classification, it is usually performed in a noise-free environment. Also, works on PD pattern classification are mostly done on lab fabricated insulators, where works on actual cable joint defects are less likely to be found in literature. Therefore, in this work, classifications of cable joint defect types from partial discharge measurement under noisy environment were performed. Five XLPE cable joints with artificially created defects were prepared based on the defects commonly encountered on-site. A high noise tolerance principal component analysis (PCA)-based feature extraction was proposed and compared against conventional input features such as statistical and fractal features. These input features were used to train the classifiers to classify each defect type in the cable joint samples. Classifications were performed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It was found that the proposed PCA features displayed the highest noise tolerance with the least performance degradation compared to other input features under noisy environment. © 2016 IEEE.       "

Hence it is important for the utilities to identify such defective samples as early as possible so that appropriate replacement strategies can be devised. The work presented in this paper involves the investigation of a number of cases of insulator defects, with the goal of developing an online RF-based PD technique for monitoring ceramic disc insulators.

Phased resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns are commonly used to identify PD sources. However, multiple, concurrent PD sources sometimes result in partially overlapped patterns, which make them hard to be identified. In this paper, we develop an accurate, reliable algorithm by constructing a novel two-step logistic regression (LR) model to conduct probabilistic identification of multi-source PDs. To this end, principal component analysis is applied on a database to construct a low dimensional space associated with single-source PDs. Samples of multi-source PDs are then projected onto this space and one-class kernel support vector machine is adopted to distinguish multi-source PDs from single-source ones. Finally, classification is performed by estimating the probability (degree of membership) of each PRPD pattern arising from different multi-source PDs following two rounds of LR modeling. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we study a number of multi-source PD models to simulate common defects of Gas-Insulated Switchgear (GIS) in small-scale laboratory test cells with realistic SF6 gas condition. Observations are obtained using fingerprints generated by a novel approach from recorded PRPD patterns. Comprehensive performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm and its advantages are conducted and the development of analytical equations is presented.

However, due to the highly complex structures of the windings and statistical nature of PD, the exact location of a PD source is quite difficult to discover. In this paper, a technique based on an Archimedean copula is proposed to find the location of a PD source in a transformer winding. The winding responses to the PD signals of known pulse-widths applied at all the sections are taken as reference data. Further, the winding responses, obtained from the PD pulses of random shapes and magnitudes applied across various sections of the winding, are taken as test data. To predict the location of the test signals, the best-fit copula and its parameters are established using the reference and test data. The maximum value of log-likelihood between the reference data and the test signal indicates the location of the PD source. Firstly, simulation case-studies are conducted to demonstrate how the proposed approach can be implemented to locate the PD source. The results of the proposed method are then compared with the time-domain and frequency-domain based correlation techniques. Finally, the proposed method is tested with experimental data acquired from a laboratory scale model of the transformer winding.

This presents a great obstacle to the accurate diagnosis and prediction of partial discharge (PD) defects. This paper describes a method to monitor the growth process of electrical trees in pressboards based on solution of the inverse problem for the electrostatic field. The three-dimensional structure of the carbonized branches is reconstructed from the positions of PDs. Each PD is located by the charge remaining in the material. This charge is calculated from the electric field intensity or potential at some points in the field using the mirror image method and solution of the inverse problem for the electrostatic field. The electric field intensity is measured using an array of metal strips near the zero-potential border while PDs are occurring. High-voltage PD experiments are performed on oil-impregnated pressboard strips to verify the feasibility of the method. From the results of these experiments, the accuracy of PD site location is found to be as good as 0.35 mm in the χ direction (the horizontal coordinate), which is sufficient to describe the general structure of electrical trees in oil-impregnated pressboard. The movement of the PD positions indicates the growth process of tree branches. The calculated positions and lengths of the branches are consistent with observations of carbonized tracks after the pressboard has been torn open. The results obtained here will be of benefit to establishing a real-time monitoring method for three-dimensional reconstruction of electrical trees to reveal their internal growth mechanism in opaque materials such as oil-impregnated pressboards. © 1994-2012 IEEE.

The results show that DenseNet models can achieve high accuracy within a reasonable training time. The accurate detection and classification of discharge sources provide the backbone of a dielectric online condition monitoring system (DOCMS) that can actively monitor the health of electrical equipment in an electric aircraft. © 1994-2012 IEEE.

Balouji, et al.",2022,Classification of Partial Discharges Originating from Multilevel PWM Using Machine Learning,10.1109/TDEI.2022.3148461,"A partial discharge (PD) is a small, localized breakdown which often appears in high-voltage insulation systems. PDs can be initiated within material defects such as voids or cracks when exposed to sufficiently high electric field levels. In this research work, we study and propose a machine learning (ML) approach to detect and classify PDs originating from multilevel pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveforms as utilized in power electronic devices, such as inverters and variable frequency drives. Due to the increased use of power conversion units, new types of higher magnitude PDs have been observed to increase insulation degradation. By creating a cavity placed at different locations within the test object and exposing it to PWM voltage waveforms with two different rise times, a total of 345 660 PD events are recorded and organized into ten different classes. The maximum PD amplitude, duration, the time distance between consecutive PDs, and the area under the PD are used as features for PD classification. A unique way of concatenating a sequence of the extracted features to capture the temporal dependence of consecutive PDs is also presented. It is observed that when creating a sequence of information from consecutive observed PDs, a significant increase in classification accuracy can be obtained. Trained classifiers based on ensemble bagged decision trees (DTs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture resulted in 95.3% and 98.5% average classification accuracy on test data respectively. © 1994-2012 IEEE.

This article proposes an oil-immersed transformer PD pattern recognition method based on a multifrequency fiber-optic Fabry-Perot (F-P) ultrasound sensing array and deep learning (DL). Three F-P ultrasonic probes with different resonance bands were used to form a sensing array for collecting ultrasonic signals excited by PD. Five types of PD models were prepared, including metal tip (MT) discharge in oil, PD in the air cavity (AC), and surface discharge (SD) on the pressboard, in addition to SD after pressboard blocking or after pressboard plus transformer winding blocking, to study the influence of ultrasonic attenuation on recognition accuracy. The collected PD ultrasound signal time-frequency matrix was obtained using adaptive optimal-kernel time-frequency representation to reinforce the differences in PD patterns. Then, based on the features of the PD ultrasonic signals, the signal time and frequency band for analysis were determined. The intercepted time-frequency matrix of the signals from the three F-P probes was formed into a (3, 300, 375) tensor. A modified ResNet-18 net was used for PD pattern recognition, which achieved a 98% recognition accuracy.

Impedance matching circuit (IMC) was used to measure the electrical PD. The acoustic PD was obtained through an acoustic emission (AE) sensor and preamplifier gain unit. In total, 112 coordinates for each of the AE sensors were utilized to evaluate the location of the PD. Once the voltage reached 30 kV, the electrical and acoustic PDs were recorded. Next, the data were preprocessed by moving average (MA) and analyzed by time of arrival (TOA), ANFIS, and ANN. The distance between PD and AE sensor was calculated based on TOA to determine the PD location. These information were used as an input to train the network by optimizing epoch and neuron for ANFIS and ANN in order to locate PD. ANFIS has the best percentage of PD source prediction based on root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) as compared to ANN.

Traditionally, there are problems such as unclear boundaries for the classification of different stages in the evolution of protrusion defects. The relatively low time resolution of experimental observations makes it difficult to accurately characterize single discharge processes and lacks correlations between multiple physical quantities in the evolution. To this end, an experimental platform for the joint detection of multiphysical quantities with high time resolution is first built, and the current, light, and electromagnetic signals generated in each stage of the discharge process are measured simultaneously. On this basis, the variation patterns and characteristics of the characteristic parameters of multiphysics signals are summarized, and the mapping relationship between the discharge process and the characteristic quantities is established. The corresponding physical explanation and the mechanism analysis are also provided. Finally, 3-D data characteristic values composed of current, light, and electromagnetic are comprehensively constructed to objectively classify the discharge state of protrusion defects into four levels using cluster analysis methods.

Measurement of partial discharges (PDs) is commonly employed to monitor the health of the insulation materials of such assets, and the detection of the PD sources would help justify remedial actions such as inspection and repair. Before classifying the PD sources, the identification of the number of PD sources is necessary (clustering of the PD pulses). Different clustering techniques have been used for this purpose such as time-frequency maps, K-means clustering, and principal component analysis. However, there are limitations in these techniques in regard to the additional information that these algorithms need. For example, the number of clusters and the minimum distance between data points must be assumed in some algorithms. In order to overcome the mentioned limitations, a robust unsupervised deep learning model is proposed for unsupervised clustering, based on a convolutional AE and an adaptive clustering technique. In a laboratory setup, defects are introduced to a generator stator bar, simulating common PD sources, and PD-induced pulses in the ground connection of the bar are measured. The inputs to the deep learning model are the unlabelled, time-series PD pulses, and the output is the predicted number of PD sources. The proposed system showed better prediction of the number of PD sources compared to the existing techniques, which require human judgment. In addition, the proposed system demonstrated immunity to noise, where additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is added artificially to the measured PD waveforms. © 1994-2012 IEEE.       "

Among the parts of transformers whose health status may affect their performance is oil-impregnated paper (OIP) bushings. Therefore, OIP bushings must be monitored to ensure safe transformer operation. It is important to note that moisture is one of the factors that can damage the OIP bushing. Therefore, effective evaluation of moisture in OIP bushings is crucial to ensure the safe operation of power systems. Previous studies have revealed, however, that the insulation's aging can cause inaccurate moisture level predictions. Consequently, OIP bushing aging should be considered when estimating moisture levels. In recent years, the frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) technique has been widely used to evaluate the insulation conditions of OIPs. This study introduced a novel approach to evaluate the insulation conditions of OIP bushings based on the FDS results. Twenty-three sets of oil-paper samples with different insulation conditions were selected. Moreover, eight features are introduced to extract from tanδ -f curves of OIP samples. Using the values of eight extracted features and the regression analysis, a database containing values of eight features and their corresponding insulation conditions was established. A novel technique was proposed based on the triangle's area similarity-sector's area similarity (TS-SS) to predict the moisture content and aging degree of OIP bushings. The verification results showed that the average relative error of moisture level and aging degree predictions is 5.57% and 7.32%, respectively.

The results based on measured partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) values and using electric field distribution obtained via electrostatic simulations and ionization swarm parameters reveal that the Schumann constant, K, which is the natural logarithm of the threshold number of electrons determining the transition from Townsend to streamer discharge, and consequently, the critical avalanche size (Nc) increase with air pressure reduction. Different SIPs such as critical field line length (CFLL), effective ionization coefficient of air ( α eff), PD inception field (Einc), firing voltage (Vfiring) across the critical field line (CFL), and K and N c are analyzed extensively as a function of air pressure. In light of the findings of this contribution, it is demonstrated that the derived K functions as a function of air pressure can improve drastically the accuracy of PDIV prediction in particular for low air pressures rather than a single K parameter value obtained at ground level.

Additionally, the breakdown field strengths of the insulation gaps at different gas pressures are studied. When the barrier is placed near the plate electrode, the breakdown field strength shows a linear increase with increasing gas pressure.

Most denoising algorithms require manual parameter tuning, making it challenging to achieve effective field denoising and consistent denoising performance. To solve these problems, this article proposes an adaptive denoising algorithm. The algorithm is divided into two steps: preliminary denoising and secondary denoising. The preliminary denoising combines variational mode decomposition (VMD) with the Ljung-Box (LB) white noise test. The signal is decomposed into different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and the LB white noise test is used for the adaptive classification of PD components and noise components. After preliminary denoising, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the original signal is improved. After that, the particle swarm algorithm (PSO) is combined with wavelet threshold denoising (WTD) to perform secondary denoising of the signal. The algorithm improves the threshold value by adapting it to the field noise level and enhances the threshold function to resolve issues of instability and fixed deviation in traditional functions. Meanwhile, adjustment coefficients are introduced to them so that they can be optimized in the denoising process. A novel denoising evaluation metric, the QLB of noise residual (QNR), which provides a more accurate assessment of denoising performance compared with traditional metrics is proposed. Taking it as the objective function, the PSO algorithm is used to achieve an adaptive optimal selection of parameters in the denoising process. The denoising results of both the simulated and experimental PD signals show that the proposed method can effectively remove the white noise and recover the PD signal more accurately. © 1994-2012 IEEE.

In this paper, a practical diagnostic method is proposed based on an improved self-organizing map (SOM) with improved clustering indications. Three feature extraction methods are employed for the SOM implementation, including Weibull analysis, statistical operators, and fractal parameters. Experimental PD data of industrial model bars are used to validate the efficiency of using SOM for PD classification. The method is applied to investigate the turbine generator analyzer (TGA) data obtained from a power plant of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. Diagnostic results are included to demonstrate that the relationship between the new PD measurement and historical data can be visualized and more confidential diagnostic information can be provided, especially when small-size database, new class of data, and doubtful measurements are involved in a practical environment.

Hoffmann, et al.",2021,Method for the Prediction of the Potential Distribution in Electrical Machine Windings under Pulse Voltage Stress,10.1109/TEC.2020.3026531,This article provides an applicable method to predict the distribution of the electric potential inside the winding of an electrical machine with a reasonable set of parameters. It extends the understanding of the winding impedance in terms of the inter-winding behavior and gives us the opportunity to properly design the insulation system during the development phase of an electrical machine. Predictions are backed up by measurements and an in-depth look at the measurement setup. The results proof nonuniform potential distribution and show that the potential difference between individual turns exceeds the amplitude of the phase voltage. Our findings also establish an interrelation between the winding impedance and the potential oscillations inside the winding.

Radun, et al.",1981,Dc power line charging of macroscopic particles and associated electrical precipitation on insulators,10.1109/TEI.1981.298415,"The objective is a model for estimating the rate of electrical precipitation of macroscopic particles onto insulators where the particle charging is due to ions generated by the line and associated apparatus. The general theoretical structure required to describe particle charging and convective turbulent diffusion in a state-space of position and mobility is developed as a basis for predicting deposition in specific configurations. A wind tunnel facility is described for testing predictions of the theory for charging in the vicinity of a power line. The tunnel is equipped to control the turbulence level, with monodisperse zero-charge particles introduced upstream of a cable which is itself in a controlled state of corona discharge. Equipment for measuring the spatial distribution and mobility distribution at a downstream plane includes an electric analyzer, particle neutralizer, and mass monitor. The theoretical model, which predicts the lower extreme of the observed mobility distribution but a lesser spread than found experimentally, points to either a need for greater resolution in the mobility spectrum analyzer, or the existence of near-line turbulence generation associated with corona wind.

Injecting faults into equipment is a means for a malevolent attacker to extract secret information.

It performs more accurate measurements of the disturbance power, reducing the measurement error by 20.33 dB. Second, we propose an advanced analysis methodology allowing an attacker or a countermeasure designer to identify the disturbance frequency leading to the most powerful attack. As an illustration, the method is applied on an ASIC implementation of DES, providing a thorough characterization and classification of the generated faults. In this case, the most powerful attacks are performed when the disturbance has a frequency below 1 MHz. The threat has thus to be considered really serious, as generating such disturbance does not require a high budget. © 1964-2012 IEEE.       "

Zhou, et al.",2023,Reinforced Two-Stream Fuzzy Neural Networks Architecture Realized With the Aid of One-Dimensional/Two-Dimensional Data Features,10.1109/TFUZZ.2022.3186181,"A novel structure of reinforced two-stream fuzzy neural networks (TSFNNs) realized with the aid of fuzzy logic and transfer learning method is presented. This architecture consists of a TSFNN and a fusion strategy. TSFNN architecture consists of two combined networks of both fuzzy rules-based radial basis function neural networks (FRBFNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In the TSFNN architecture, one stream employs the deep CNN to extract the spatial information of images and effectively learn the high-level features and another stream uses the FRBFNN to analyze the distribution of data points over the input space and learn to capture complex relationships in data. In the fusion strategy, the outputs of two streams are concatenated by a softmax function, which normalizes the output to a probability distribution. A transfer learning method is considered to reconstruct new data representation as the inputs of CNN to mine potential spatial features of data. Moreover, L2-norm regularization is used to alleviate the possible overfitting and enhance the generalization ability. The proposed method not only inherits the advantages of FRBFNN and CNN such as global feature extraction ability, good local approximating performance, ability of handling uncertainty by fuzzy logic but also improves the classification performance under the synergy between two-stream architecture and the fusion strategy. Experimental results obtained for a diversity of datasets as well as partial discharge datasets be using in the real life of fault diagnosis and black plastic wastes datasets for recycling confirm the effectiveness of the proposed TSFNN. A comprehensive comparative analysis is covered. This design can simultaneously capture different level information of inputs and easing the insufficient problem of extracting features from a single steam.

"Y. Gao, et al.",2023,A Combined RFI Localization Algorithm of BT Image and Subspace Decomposition for Synthetic Aperture Interferometric Radiometer,10.1109/TGRS.2023.3280443,"Radio frequency interferences (RFIs) in the L-band heavily contaminate remote sensing data and bring many challenges to the product quality of synthesis aperture interferometric radiometers (SAIRs). Detecting and localizing RFIs is the urgent need for switching off these RFIs and conducting mitigation algorithms. The localization algorithm based on the brightness temperature (BT) image is limited by the resolution to separate closely spaced RFIs and achieve high localization accuracy in some cases. To achieve super-resolution, the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) methods using the subspace decomposition technique are suggested. Nevertheless, when the BT image signal-noise ratio (SNR) is low, the power of RFI is insufficient to overwhelm the background scene, and the performance of the MUSIC algorithm is unsatisfactory. In this article, a further improvement is proposed by combining BT image and subspace decomposition. In the BT image domain, background scene cancellation and RFI target enhancement are carried out for enhancing the SNR. In the frequency domain, the MUSIC algorithm is applied to utilize subspace-decomposition to achieve super-resolution localization. Experiments and simulations based on Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) data validate that the method presented in this article performs better than both the classical MUSIC algorithm and BT-based localization algorithm in low SNR cases. © 1980-2012 IEEE.

"K. A. Sorensen, et al.",2023,Finding Ground-Based Radars in SAR Images: Localizing Radio Frequency Interference Using Unsupervised Deep Learning,10.1109/TGRS.2023.3295002,"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images are used increasingly more for Earth observation. While SAR images are useable in most conditions, they occasionally experience image degradation due to interfering signals from external radars, called radio frequency interference (RFI). RFI-affected images are often discarded in further analysis or preprocessed to remove the RFI. However, few on-ground radars can cause RFI in SAR images and such information can thus increase domain awareness greatly over both land and sea, where, e.g., localizing and characterizing RFI signals in the ocean could help classify otherwise overlooked ships. The aim of the current study is to detect and localize RFI signals automatically in Sentinel-1 level-1 images and further characterize the on-ground radar. The spatial structure of RFI signals vary greatly. A convolutional autoencoder (CAE) was therefore developed to reconstruct RFI-free Sentinel-1 images. Conversely, RFI-affected images could not be well reconstructed. Anomalous heatmaps were then developed to automatically detect and localize RFI anomalies in the images under varying environmental and geographical conditions, whereafter the external radar characteristics were extracted manually from Sentinel-1 level-0 data. We could consequently classify and localize RFI signals believed to originate from both stationary radars and ship-borne radars. We further argue that the calculated ship-borne radar characteristics correspond to those of air-surveillance radars. Empirically, the method showed better detection results than those of previous studies. Our study shows that more information can be extracted from certain detected objects, such as ships, from SAR images. © 1980-2012 IEEE.       "

The charge acquired by cylinders of various dielectric constants was evaluated with a computer program based on the boundary element method of field analysis. The experimental setup simulated the charging conditions of millimeter-size calibrated cylinders of polyvinyl chloride in a roll-type electrostatic separator, the unipolar space charge being generated by a wire-type electrode. The experimental results, which were in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, put forward that the relative spacing between the particles changes the value of the saturation charge, an effect, which is stronger for particles of higher dielectric constant. These facts should be taken into account in the design of any electrostatic technology based on the corona charging of granular matter.       "

The method is based on a supervised classification approach which utilizes histogram similarity analysis. The motivation for choosing histogram similarity analysis is twofold. First, the phase-resolved PD measurement itself is, in fact, a two-dimensional histogram. Therefore, a histogram-matching-based approach suits the very nature of the data. Second, histogram similarity analysis combines the typical statistical parameters, used in PD analysis, in a statistically powerful and rigorous way. In our study, we utilize various histogram types and similarity analysis, including correlation, chi-square, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Further, we propose a postprocessing method to quantify the accuracy of classification results which enables the user to make soft decisions. Our experimental study on laboratory samples demonstrates that the method shows strong potential in detection and classification of insulation defects.

A number of TF detection techniques have been proposed; however, there is currently no method available for distinguishing TFs from high-resistance (R) connections (HRCs), which also result in three-phase system asymmetry. It is important to distinguish the two faults, since an HRC does not necessarily require immediate motor shutdown. In this paper, new sensorless online monitoring techniques for detecting and classifying stator TFs and high-R electrical connections in induction machines based on the zero-sequence voltage or negative-sequence current measurements are proposed. An experimental study on a 10-hp induction motor performed under simulated TFs and high-R circuit conditions verifies that the two faults can be reliably detected and classified. The proposed technique helps improve the reliability, efficiency, and safety of the motor system and industrial plant and also allows maintenance to be performed in a more efficient manner, since the course of action can be determined based on the type and severity of the fault. © 2009 IEEE.

Tightly packed MF transformer windings carrying pulsewidth modulation (PWM) voltages create favorable conditions for PD inception due to proximity between adjacent winding conductors and electric field enhancement because of spiral geometry. A peak potential condition is created between the adjacent posterior conductors of the primary and secondary windings as a result of phase-shifted modulation. This along with fast alternating electric fields incepts PD at lower than expected operating voltages. Early inception of PD leads to premature transformer failure leading to unanticipated dc SST down-time.

To settle the abovementioned issue, we propose a multitask learning network (MTLN) for GIS PD condition assessment. First, a multitask network was developed, taking severity assessment as the main task and diagnosis and localization as parallel auxiliary tasks. This model not only facilitates the extraction of the coupling relationship between diagnosis and localization but also furnishes pertinent feature information for severity assessment.

The process of subdomain adaptation considers the alignment of both intraclass and interclass information, incorporating a secondary filtering mechanism to mitigate the issue of feature mismatch caused by incorrect pseudo labels.

The method makes use of the fast match-based vector quantization procedure, wherein a given partial discharge pattern is matched against a set of known partial discharge patterns in a database. The ΔQ-V partial discharge patterns for different cavity sizes are considered as a sequence of events rather than as ΔQ-V curve representations. In the training phase, each cavity size represents a unique class, which emits its own ΔQ-V sequence, and vector quantization (VQ) is used to assign labels for this sequence of events. In the testing phase, a fast match algorithm is proposed to determine the degree of similarity between the labels of the tested phenomena and the prestored labels for different partial discharge patterns previously stored during the training phase. The best-matched model pinpoints the cavity size class.

PD measurements, however, are corrupted with different types of noises such as white noise, random noise, and discrete spectral interferences. Hence, the denoising of such corrupted PD signals remains a challenging problem in PD signal detection and classification. The challenge lies in removing these noises from the online PD signal measurements effectively, while retaining its discriminant features and characteristics. In this paper, wavelet-based denoising with a new histogram-based threshold function and selection rule is proposed. The proposed threshold estimation technique obtains two different threshold values for each wavelet sub-band and uses a prodigious thresholding function that conserves the original signal energy. Moreover, two signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation techniques are derived to fit with actual PD signals corrupted with real noise. The proposed technique is applied on different acoustic and current measured PD signals to examine its performance under different noisy environments. The simulation results confirm the merits of the proposed denoising technique compared with other existing wavelet-based techniques by measuring four evaluation metrics: 1) SNR; 2) cross-correlation coefficient; 3) mean square error; and 4) reduction in noise level. © 2015 IEEE.

Hussein, et al.",2017,Robust Feature Extraction and Classification of Acoustic Partial Discharge Signals Corrupted With Noise,10.1109/TIM.2016.2639678,"Partial discharge (PD) can be used as an indicator of impending failure in electrical plant insulation making the accurate classification of particular occurrence patterns useful for anticipating forthcoming outages. In this paper, we propose a feature extraction method that is robust to noise and can effectively select the most discriminant features of PD signals. Specifically, we follow three main steps. First, the spectrum of the PD signals is obtained using fast Fourier transform. Then, the low-frequency components are truncated and selected as PD representative features. Finally, these features are fed to the classifier and the detection accuracy is evaluated. In this paper, we consider the classification problem between three different types of acoustic PD signals, which are sharp, surface, and void PDs. Eight different classification models are adopted to test the PD detection accuracy along with the proposed scheme. Results on a benchmark data set illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on PD detection, while it yields a 100% classification accuracy (CA) for noise-free PD data. The robustness of the proposed method is also verified, where it achieves a CA up to 95.98% and 99.62% for noisy PD signals contaminated with high level of white and random noise, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to actual PD signals corrupted with real noise; a CA between 98.16% and 98.64% is achieved. © 2016 IEEE.       "

To overcome the limitation of conventional diagnosis approaches, which misclassify new types of faults into existing categories from training, a novel probabilistic diagnosis framework will be proposed in this paper for effective detection on new data categories. Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied for the pattern recognition, while its training procedure is improved from conventional unsupervised learning to novel semisupervised learning. Even with unlabeled training data, component number in our GMM can be autoselected instead of predetermined. For online testing, the probabilistic classification results from GMM's soft assignment assist to improve overall diagnosis framework, which is able to first detect whether new types of faults occur and further categorize them in detail via the GMM update. The effectiveness of our fault diagnosis framework is testified on an industrial fault simulator of rotary machine and the partial discharge measurement of various high-voltage electronic equipment components. Compared with existing approaches, our probabilistic diagnosis framework is able to achieve an average diagnosis accuracy of 97.9% without new data categories and it can also classify new data categories with diagnosis accuracy of at least 86.3% if occurred. © 2017 IEEE.

Wang, et al.",2020,Separating multi-source partial discharge signals using linear prediction analysis and isolation forest algorithm,10.1109/TIM.2019.2926688,"Partial discharge (PD) detection is an effective way to find defects and diagnose the insulation condition of power equipment. During manufacturing and operating, there may exist multi-source PD signals in the equipment, which could seriously affect the accuracy of subsequent defect analyses. In this paper, a universal separation methodology using linear prediction analysis (LPA) and the isolation forest algorithm (IFA) is introduced. By approximating the present waveform point by a linear combination of several points in the past, a 12-D linear prediction cepstrum coefficient (LPCC) feature space can be established which can accurately characterize PD waveforms. In this paper, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature space to 2-D space. The IFA was adopted to separate multi-source PD signals which quantified the degree of clustering and added one more parameter based on the original features. Thus, the proposed method can separate multiple PD sources effectively even if the difference in the features of different types of PDs is small. In addition, the proposed algorithm easily removed the noise points during the separation process. The algorithm was applied to different types of PD signals on 35-kV transformers and a three-source PD data set on a 252-kV gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) platform. The separation results confirm that the proposed algorithm can effectively separate and distinguish various PD signals. © 1963-2012 IEEE.       "

Guo, et al.",2021,Fault Diagnosis Based on Multiscale Texture Features of Cable Terminal on EMU of High-Speed Railway,10.1109/TIM.2020.3025375,"The problem to identify the type of source generating discharges detected during campaigns of partial discharge (PD) measurements in cable terminal is of utmost importance in the quality control and state detection of the power supply system of a high-speed railway train. The purpose of this article is to provide a novel PD feature and a potential tool for cable terminal PD identification. The traditional PD type of high-speed train cable terminal is usually identified by PD test parameters, such as amplitude, PD times, and discharge energy. These features contain limited information and are easily affected by external factors, resulting in large numerical fluctuations, making the reliability of the test results low, which makes the operation, maintenance, and repair decision of high-speed train cables very difficult. Therefore, this article proposes a method that can extract rich feature information from PD data and distinguish PD types accurately and reliably by combining with a classification algorithm. First, to make full use of the characteristics of PD data, the single-scale PRPD images are transformed into multiscale PRPD images by using image pyramid theory. Then, the first-order texture statistics, the second-order texture statistics, and the higher order texture statistics are extracted from the multiscale PRPD space. Finally, the input features are optimized and classified by random forest and compared with other feature extraction algorithms. The results show that this method can identify PD type accurately and reliably, and the recognition accuracy is better than that of a single PD discharge feature. © 1963-2012 IEEE.       "

Compared with traditional UHF time-difference-based techniques, this RSSI-based AOA localization method is a more economical solution. In addition, by comparing the measured RSSI vector to a prebuilt reliable reference data set, the MUSIC method can effectively locate the direction of the PD source with high accuracy. Compared with the method that directly determines the smallest RSSI values by several sensors, this method can accomplish localization by fewer sensors without impeding accuracy. Furthermore, the interpolation method was adopted to improve the precision of the relationship curve of AOA/RSSI, which it did with a limited number of sensors.

The intensity of PD defects increases continuously with time, which may lead to insulation failure. In some cases, multiple PD defects may occur concurrently leading to a faster equipment failure.This article presents a methodology for the separation of multiple PD defects in low-voltage motors. The characteristics of the recorded PD signals have been investigated to estimate the severity of these defects. The cumulative energy (CE) function in the time domain has been calculated from the PD signals and its significant features, which include amplitude, range, skewness, kurtosis, autocorrelation functions, cross correlation functions, and width parameter of CE signals, have been compared for the separation of various defects. Therefore, 6-D feature space consisting of peak value, dispersion, symmetry, sharpness, similarity, and shape features of CE functions has been produced for the separation of multiple defects in the motors. Finally, the K-mean clustering classification algorithm has been adopted using significant features of CE functions to discover their clusters in the feature space.

Different PD sources have diverse impacts on insulation, and PDs measured at different locations exhibit unique energy characteristics. An approach based on the energy characteristics of the PD signal is proposed here to locate PD inside the winding. An electrical detection method has been considered with PD pulses measured at the top and bottom of the winding through high-frequency current transformers (HFCTs). To reveal multiscale intrinsic characteristics of the PD signal, authors extracted intrinsic mode function (IMF) using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). Next, the instantaneous energy distribution-permutation entropy (PE-IED) values of the first several IMFs were calculated to capture the energy of the PD.

However, CNN ignores the correlation between the local areas of the feature space, resulting in insufficient feature utilization. Moreover, deploying and applying the methods explored in massive laboratory data to complex and few-shot conditions on-site is a difficult problem currently. Therefore, this study proposes a novel domain adaptation graph convolutional network (DAGCN) for GIS insulation defect diagnosis. First, the graph signal and graph convolution network are used to take advantage of the correlation between the local areas of the feature space while employing the numerical characteristics of the insulation defect signal. Then, the learned diagnostic method is deployed to the on-site GIS insulation defect diagnosis with domain adaptive transfer learning (TL). The difference between the two tasks is reduced by minimizing the difference between the marginal and conditional distributions of the source and target domains, thus, realizing the feature migration. The experimental verification shows that DAGCN has higher diagnostic accuracy and robustness than traditional methods, especially in diagnosing few-shot on-site.

Classification and clinical score prediction are performed jointly to facilitate early PD diagnosis. Specifically, the proposed approach performs united embedding and sparse regression, which can determine the similarity matrices and discriminative features adaptively. Meanwhile, we constrain the similarity matrix among subjects and exploit the l2,p norm to conduct sparse adaptive control for obtaining the intrinsic information of the multimodal data structure. An effective iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. We perform abundant experiments on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data set to verify the validity of the proposed approach. The results show that our approach boosts the performance on the classification and clinical score regression of longitudinal data and surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2012 IEEE.       "
"C. Lynde, et al.",2020,Optimization of the Charge Comparison Method for Multiradiation Field Using Various Measurement Systems,10.1109/TNS.2020.2966886,"This article presents a procedure for optimizing the charge comparison method (CCM) used for pulse shape discrimination (PSD). Without prior knowledge of the signals or the readout system, our procedure automatically optimizes the integration periods maximizing the discrimination ability of the radiation detector. This procedure is innovative in its adaptability and automation without being complicated to implement on a standard computer. Another advantage of this approach is the possibility to use it even if the operation of the readout system and the recording process of the signal is not fully known. Therefore, it enables all detection systems generating signals whose temporal evolution depends on the origin to optimize the integration periods of the CCM. Our procedure is based on verifying that two criteria are met in terms of the number of components and the correlation of Gaussian fits made on the distribution of the tail-to-total integral resulting from the CCM. We tested the procedure for different application cases. First, the optimization of the integration periods of the CCM was performed for the discrimination between fast neutrons and gamma rays with a plastic scintillator and a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) in the energy range [250 keVee; 4.5 MeVee]. The integration periods, from the laboratory's experience with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and plastic scintillators, gave a Figure of Merit (FoM) of 0.58 corresponding to a rejection ratio (RR) of 8.6%. The procedure improved the FoM up to 0.88 corresponding to a RR of 1.9%. We also applied the procedure to the discrimination between beta and gamma rays with a PMT and a phoswich organic detector and to the discrimination between signals collected from neutrons or partial discharges within a fission chamber. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

Diaz, et al.",2017,Generation of Duplicated Off-Line Signature Images for Verification Systems,10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2560810,"Biometric researchers have historically seen signature duplication as a procedure relevant to improving the performance of automatic signature verifiers. Different approaches have been proposed to duplicate dynamic signatures based on the heuristic affine transformation, nonlinear distortion and the kinematic model of the motor system. The literature on static signature duplication is limited and as far as we know based on heuristic affine transforms and does not seem to consider the recent advances in human behavior modeling of neuroscience. This paper tries to fill this gap by proposing a cognitive inspired algorithm to duplicate off-line signatures. The algorithm is based on a set of nonlinear and linear transformations which simulate the human spatial cognitive map and motor system intra-personal variability during the signing process. The duplicator is evaluated by increasing artificially a training sequence and verifying that the performance of four state-of-the-art off-line signature classifiers using two publicly databases have been improved on average as if we had collected three more real signatures. © 2017 IEEE.

However, very little research has been published on PD behaviors under square-wave pulses with ultrafast dv/dt. To address this problem, this article studies the PD behaviors of direct bonded copper samples with different trench distances and chamfer radii under single and repetitive square pulses with ultrafast dv/dt. The results show that for the single-pulse excitation partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) decreases with increasing rise time if the pulsewidth is shorter than 300 μs, and PDIV decreases with increasing pulsewidth. For repetitive pulse excitation, PDIV increases linearly with trench distance if the chamfer radius is larger than 0.5 mm, while it follows a concave curve if the chamfer radius is less than 0.5 mm. On the other hand, for a fixed trench distance, the PDIV changes quadratically with the chamfer radius increasing from 0 (right angle) to 0.7 mm. Based on the experimental results, a PD model with bubble expansion theory is to explain the PD mechanism under ultrafast dv/dt excitation, and an empirical equation for PDIV prediction is also derived. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

The experimental data were examined by using two empirical formulae, showing that the two expressions hold for both polarities. The empirical formulae have estimated current with the mean relative error less than 3% for positive corona and 6% for negative corona.

Generally, the conventional phase-resolved PD (PRPD) and pulse-sequence analysis methods are adopted to discriminate PD sources.

It is shown that this approach greatly improves the detection rate and lowers false positives compared to the previous algorithm used for partial discharge detection based on the data from an antenna, making it fit to use in the production environment. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

Lu, et al.",2024,Study of Electrostatic Motion Behavior and Inhibition of Metallic Particles in GIS/GIL,10.1109/TPWRD.2023.3322702,"The most frequent insulation defect appears to be the presence of small amounts of spherical, linear, and other shapes of micro metallic particles in Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) and Gas Insulated Transmission Line (GIL). It poses a major risk for partial discharge if the metallic particles travel to the location with a high field strength. The study to inhibit the movement of metal particles and thus solve the issue of metallic particle contamination is the key technical challenge to effectively improve the insulation strength. In this article, we present a mathematical-physical model applicable to the real structure with complex electric field and various types of particles using the finite element method (FEM) and the differential element method (DEM). This study shows that the asymmetry of the electrostatic force caused by the asymmetry of the particle shape is the main cause of the complex motion behavior. The model can predict several unique occurrences, including the one-sided lifting of longer linear particles, and our experiments have confirmed these predictions. The method of dielectric coating for particle motion inhibition is investigated, and a significant inhibition effect is observed as the lift-off voltage of the particles is dramatically increased. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

Seitz, et al.",2024,Towards Generalizable Classification of Partial Discharges in Gas-Insulated HVDC Systems Using Neural Networks: Protrusions and Particles,10.1109/TPWRD.2024.3369872,"Undetected partial discharges (PDs) are a safety critical issue in high voltage (HV) gas-insulated systems (GIS). While the diagnosis of PDs under AC voltage is well-established, the analysis of PDs under DC voltage remains an active research field. A key focus of these investigations is the classification of different PD sources to enable subsequent sophisticated analysis. In this paper, we present an analysis of a 1D-CNN-based approach for classifying laboratory PD signals caused by metallic protrusions and conductive particles on the insulator of HVDC GIS, under both negative and positive potentials. Most notably, our study demonstrates that this type of neural network, regardless of the training order, can generalize learnings to operating voltage multiples that it has not previously encountered. We evaluate this generalization performance under the presence of additional white Gaussian noise and investigate the influence of excluding the amplitude-related information in the signal. Further, we compare the network's performance when using input signals in both the time and frequency domain. © 1986-2012 IEEE.       "

Tharamal, et al.",2024,Classification of Transformer Oil Based on Ageing Severity Using Probabilistic Analysis of Partial Discharge Measurements,10.1109/TPWRD.2024.3414420,"Characterization of transformer oil is crucial for ensuring long-term reliability in the operation of power transformers. IEEE C.57.106 (2015) and IEEE C.57.637 (2015) classify fresh and in-service transformer oil based on its ageing severity with five mandatory dielectric properties, including AC breakdown voltage, water content, interfacial tension, dissipation factor, and neutralization number. However, this classification strategy allows quite a significant variation in the dielectric properties of oil samples belonging to the same oil class. It also does not directly suggest the exact reconditioning/reclamation process to pursue. Hence, the present work proposes categorizing in-service and fresh oil samples into six oil propositions: A, B, C, D, E, and F, based on the five above-mentioned tests with justified follow-up actions for each oil category. It also proposes a single partial discharge measurement as an alternative to the five tests in order to save time and resources. The prominent features of the phase-resolved partial discharge patterns are extracted to form Z marginal histograms. The oil samples are then classified using the Multinomial Naive Bayes analysis and Weibull probability density function. Finally, the oil classification, with a least error rate of 1.67%, is reported after post-processing with the Weibull analysis at 1.4° phase windows. © 1986-2012 IEEE.       "

Yang, et al.",2024,Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Lithium-Ion Batteries With Limited Degradation History Using Random Forest,10.1109/TTE.2023.3323976,"Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of a lithium-ion battery with its limited degradation history is critical as it ensures timely maintenance of electric vehicles (EVs) and efficient reuse of second-life batteries. Considering realistic battery operating conditions, this work investigates the RUL prediction under partial charge and discharge with a limited degradation history of the target cell. Given its ability to inform feature importance, the random forest is adopted to help prioritize different battery measurements and identify the least amount of operating data required for accurate RUL prediction. By examining the prediction performance using one complete charge and discharge cycle, it is shown that the duration, used capacity, and voltage signals of both charge and discharge contain important features related to battery RUL. The prediction performance under partial charge and discharge is also studied under state-of-charge (SOC) uncertainties, revealing satisfactory performance achieved with the data collected over the SOC range of [0.2,0.8]. Comparison with an existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that uses four complete charge and discharge cycles verifies the enhanced onboard feasibility of the proposed approach. Sensitivity analysis against SOC ranges shows that the data in the SOC range of [0.1,0.2] contain the richest RUL-related information for lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells. Extensive validation on cells with different chemistry, ambient temperatures, and C rates further demonstrates the robustness of the proposed approach. © 2015 IEEE.       "

Ji, et al.",2024,Lifetime Model for Inverter-fed Electrical Machines Windings Including Thermal Aging and Partial Discharge Risk,10.1109/TTE.2024.3461831,"Reliability is a paramount feature in electrical machines (EMs) designed for mobility applications and the demand for high-performance EMs poses a serious threat to the electrical insulation system (EIS) integrity. In high-performance EMs, the EIS is exposed to enhanced stresses, such as undesired thermal aging and partial discharge (PD) risk. In accordance with IEC 60034-18-41, the inception of PD is considered as EIS end-of-life criterion, and a thermal aging enhancement factor is introduced in PD risk assessment for including the EIS thermal degradation. These recommendations enable the EM PD-free design, but do not allow the insulation lifetime evaluation under thermal and electrical stresses, which would ensure the reliability level required by a given application since the first EM design steps. To tackle this challenge, a tailored windings lifetime model for inverter-fed EMs is proposed and built relying on an extensive experimental database. The partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) values are collected over an accelerated thermal aging tests campaign involving three aging temperatures and at least ten diagnostic sub-cycles per aging temperature. The derived winding lifetime model is meant to be used during the EM design process for reliability check and it is applicable to a variety of transportation applications by simply updating the PDIV threshold according to inter-turn voltage and environmental conditions. The applicability and versatility of the proposed winding lifetime model are proved through two transportation study cases (i.e., automotive and aerospace). © 2015 IEEE.       "

Therefore, we propose a remaining useful life (RUL) estimation framework for LIBs using a novel Health Indicator 'discharge pulse power (DPP)' that is suitable for both complete and partial discharge conditions. The main contribution consists of virtually predicting the end of the discharge voltage using Radial Basis function based finite Gaussian sum particle filter (RBF-FGSPF) model and estimating RUL as a function of DPP in variation with the cycle number. The novelty also lies in the model architecture where the radial basis function neural network (RBFN) is adaptively trained online, i.e., it's parameters are identified by the FGSPF upon the availability of new observations. The robustness of the proposed framework is verified on the CALCE lifetime degradation dataset based on three stressors: charge cut-off current, discharge rate and ambient temperature and also validated experimentally on realistic drive profiles having variable C-rates and temperatures. The results verify that the proposed framework shows improvement of 27.89% in absolute error (AE) for all operating conditions as compared to the benchmark RUL prediction methods for LIBs. © 2015 IEEE.

This paper discusses a silicon-validated methodology for power delivery (PD) modeling and simulation. Many prior works have focused on PD analysis and optimization. However, none of them provided a comprehensive modeling methodology with postsilicon data to validate the use of the models. In this paper, we present PD system models that are able to achieve less than 10% deviation from the supply noise measurements on a 32-nm industrial double date-rate I/O design. Our models are able to capture the unique impacts of on-die inductance, state-dependent coupling capacitance, and die-package interaction. Those impacts are prominent for the designs in 32 nm or below but were considered negligible or even not noted in earlier technology nodes. Comparisons were made to quantify the impacts of different modeling strategies on supply noise prediction accuracy.

Wool fabric samples were treated with atmospheric pressure plasma-jet and corona discharge plasma to modify the surface to make the process sustainable and greener. The samples were dyed with the aqueous extract procured from the powdered roots of Rubia tinctorum L. (madder) using the ultrasonic-assisted method. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier Transform–infrared analysis were performed to investigate the effect of plasma treatment on the physical and chemical properties of wool fibres. The effects of plasma treatment type, plasma treatment parameters and the duration of dyeing on colorimetric and fastness properties were investigated. The etching of the wool fibre surface and roughness after plasma treatment were proven with scanning electron microscopy images. The Fourier Transform–infrared spectra showed that no significant differences in the functional groups of wool fibre occurred after plasma treatment. The experimental results proved that plasma treatment parameters and dyeing time had an effect on the colorimetric and fastness properties of the samples. Furthermore, an artificial neural network model was proposed for estimating the dyeing properties of wool fabrics, namely, L, a, b, K/S, colour change, rubbing fastness (dry) and rubbing fastness (wet). The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves regression values greater than 0.97 for all dyeing properties.

Saboo, et al.",2021,"Leveraging electrophysiologic correlates of word encoding to map seizure onset zone in focal epilepsy: Task-dependent changes in epileptiform activity, spectral features, and functional connectivity",10.1111/epi.17067,"Objective: Verbal memory dysfunction is common in focal, drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Unfortunately, surgical removal of seizure-generating brain tissue can be associated with further memory decline. Therefore, localization of both the circuits generating seizures and those underlying cognitive functions is critical in presurgical evaluations for patients who may be candidates for resective surgery. We used intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings during a verbal memory task to investigate word encoding in focal epilepsy. We hypothesized that engagement in a memory task would exaggerate local iEEG feature differences between the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and neighboring tissue as compared to wakeful rest (“nontask”). Methods: Ten participants undergoing presurgical iEEG evaluation for DRE performed a free recall verbal memory task. We evaluated three iEEG features in SOZ and non-SOZ electrodes during successful word encoding and compared them with nontask recordings: interictal epileptiform spike (IES) rates, power in band (PIB), and relative entropy (REN; a functional connectivity measure). Results: We found a complex pattern of PIB and REN changes in SOZ and non-SOZ electrodes during successful word encoding compared to nontask. Successful word encoding was associated with a reduction in local electrographic functional connectivity (increased REN), which was most exaggerated in temporal lobe SOZ. The IES rates were reduced during task, but only in the non-SOZ electrodes. Compared with nontask, REN features during task yielded marginal improvements in SOZ classification. Significance: Previous studies have supported REN as a biomarker for epileptic brain. We show that REN differences between SOZ and non-SOZ are enhanced during a verbal memory task. We also show that IESs are reduced during task in non-SOZ, but not in SOZ. These findings support the hypothesis that SOZ and non-SOZ respond differently to task and warrant further exploration into the use of cognitive tasks to identify functioning memory circuits and localize SOZ. © 2021 International League Against Epilepsy       "

The proposed method of hybridizing DTCWT-based feature extraction with ANN-based classification could efficiently detect several commonly occurring power quality (PQ) disturbance events. The PQ disturbance events considered include four different transient conditions, namely transients due to capacitor switching, transformer inrush currents, transients due to motor switching and transients due to short circuit faults.

As data sizes of observations grow with new and improved telescopes, the need for completely automated, robust methods for RFI mitigation is pressing.

This is a new method formed from a combination of existing techniques, including a new way of thresholding. This iterative method estimates the astronomical signal by carrying out a surface fit in the time-frequency plane. With a theoretical accuracy of 95 per cent recognition and an approximately 0.1 per cent false probability rate in simple simulated cases, the method is in practice as good as the human eye in finding RFI. In addition, it is fast, robust, does not need a data model before it can be executed and works in almost all configurations with its default parameters.

The purpose of this work was to develop an intelligent method of dough fermentation monitoring by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy technology. First, Savitzky–Golay smoothing filter was utilized as the best method to preprocess the original NIR spectra for eliminating spectral noise by comparison, and the frame size was 15. Second, the unrepresentative intervals were eliminated from preprocessed NIR spectra using synergy interval partial least squares (Si-PLS) preliminarily. Based on the selected intervals, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) was adopted to further select variables. Then, 13 significant variables were screened from full wavelength variables by utilizing CARS-Si-PLS. Finally, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) monitoring models of dough fermentation state were established. The results showed that the accuracy of training set and prediction set of KNN model were 89 and 86%, respectively, and that of SVM model were 94 and 92%, respectively. By comparison, the performance of two models, it was found that SVM was superior to KNN. This work verified that NIR spectroscopy couple with multivariate calibration models can replace assessor judgment to realize rapid and online monitoring of dough fermentation. Practical Applications: The method based on NIR spectroscopy coupled with supervised learning algorithm can be used instead of assessor to judge the fermentation state of dough, so as to avoid subjective influence of assessor on the judgment result. In addition, it can realize the rapid online monitoring of dough fermentation state, which is beneficial to enhance the automation level of Chinese steamed bread processing. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The consistent rise in offshore oil exploration activities in the last 2 decades has compelled structural engineers and researchers to better understand, the process of corrosion in offshore steel structures. The various electrochemical methods available for corrosion monitoring are polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electro chemical noise (ECN) techniques. In offshore industry, the reliable interpretation of electrochemical noise is particularly valuable since it promises new type of online monitoring device. This paper introduces ECN as an online corrosion-monitoring tool for marine structures. The paper discusses the laboratory experiments conducted on test specimens to collect data related to the electrochemical behavior of structural steel such as the polarization data, impedance measurements, electrochemical, potential, and current noise measurements. Investigations were carried out on MS coupons surface prepared and coated with anticorrosive and antifouling paints. An electrochemical workstation capable of collecting data from specimens coated with paint was used for noise data collection. Static corrosion tests have been done and the corrosion rate and corrosion resistance of the coatings were assessed using the statistical analysis. The electrochemical noise data were compared with that of polarization and impedance data and a good correlation between corrosion rates was obtained. The polarization and noise resistance were found to be similar in trend but with variation in numerical values. Statistical parameters like mean, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis were generated from the obtained noise. These parameters were then processed to obtain noise resistance and corrosion rate. The results were compared with that of polarization and impedance values. The corrosion rate comparison showed a deviation of 10% from polarization with ECN giving the upper bound values. The damage prediction and expected life prediction of a steel jacket platform were also performed using the data collected. The experiments showed a good correlation between the noise resistances obtained from various electrochemical methods. The aim of introducing the ECN as an online monitoring tool for marine structures especially in on-life offshore structures gives valid data with good results and shows good sensitivity.

The dual-tree wavelet transform is used to decompose threedimensional (3D) workpiece surfaces, and the features of workpiece surface are extracted from wavelet sub-bands of each level. Then MPO-SVME is developed to classify different workpiece surfaces based on the extracted features and the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by computing its classification accuracy. The performance of MPO-SVME is validated in case study, and the results demonstrate that MPO-SVME can increase the classification accuracy with only a handful of selected classifiers.

We computed the fractal dimension, a measure of the self-similarity of an object, along the depth axis of 44 ultrahigh-resolution OCT images of human breast tissues obtained from 4 cancer patients. Correlative histology was employed to identify distinct regions of adipose, stroma, and cancer in the OCT images.We report that the fractal dimension of stroma is significantly higher than that of cancer (P < 10 -5, t-test). Furthermore, by adjusting the cutoff values of fractal dimension between cancer, stroma, and adipose tissues, sensitivities and specificities of either 82.4% and 88.9%, or 88.2% and 81.5%, are obtained, respectively, for cancer classification.

Our database consists of 27 MR studies from 27 patients. In each study, at least four MR series of both breasts are obtained using FLASH three-dimensional (3D) acquisition at 90 s time intervals after injection of Gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) contrast agent. Each series consists of 64 coronal slices with a typical thickness of 2 mm, and a pixel size of 1.25 mm. The study contains 13 benign and 15 malignant lesions from which features are automatically extracted in 3D. These features include margin descriptors and radial gradient analysis as a function of time and space. Stepwise multiple regression is employed to obtain an effective subset of combined features. A final estimate of likelihood of malignancy is determined by linear discriminant analysis, and the performance of classification by round- robin testing and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. To assess the efficacy of 3D analysis, the study is repeated in two-dimensions (2D) using a representative slice through the middle of the lesion. In 2D and in 3D, radial gradient analysis and analysis of margin sharpness were found to be an effective combination to distinguish between benign and malignant masses (resulting area under the ROC curve: 0.96). Feature analysis in 3D was found to result in higher performance of lesion characterization than 2D feature analysis for the majority of single and combined features.

Methods: Tumor and external marker positions from a database of 188 Cyberknife Synchrony™ lung, liver, and pancreas treatment fractions were analyzed. The first ten measurements of tumor position in each fraction were used to create fraction-specific models of tumor displacement using external surrogates as input; the models were used to predict tumor position from subsequent external marker measurements. A partial least squares (PLS) model with four scores was developed for each fraction to determine T2 and Q(X) confidence limits based on the first ten measurements in a fraction. The T2 and Q(X) statistics were then calculated for every set of external marker measurements. Correlations between model error and both T2 and Q(X) were determined. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was applied to evaluate sensitivities and specificities of T2, Q(X), and T 2∪Q(X) for predicting real-time tumor localization errors >3 mm over a range of T2 and Q(X) confidence limits. Results: Sensitivity and specificity of detecting errors >3 mm varied with confidence limit selection. At 95% sensitivity, T2∪Q (X) specificity was 15, 2 higher than either T2 or Q (X) alone. The mean time to alarm for T2∪Q (X) at 95 sensitivity was 5.3 min but varied with a standard deviation of 8.2 min. Results did not differ significantly by tumor site.

"N. J. Rosenblatt, et al.",2012,Sensitivity of dynamic stability to changes in step width during treadmill walking by young adults,10.1123/jab.28.5.616,"Recent experimental findings support theoretical predictions that across walking conditions the motor system chooses foot placement to achieve a constant minimum ""margin of stability"" (MOSmin) - distance between the extrapolated center of mass and base of support. For example, while step width varies, similar average MOSmin exists between overground and treadmill walking and between overground and compliant/irregular surface walking. However, predictions regarding the invariance of MOSmin to step-by-step changes in foot placement cannot be verified by average values. The purpose of this study was to determine average changes in, and the sensitivity of MOSmin to varying step widths during two walking tasks. Eight young subjects walked on a dual-belt treadmill before and after receiving information that stepping on the physical gap between the belts causes no adverse effects. Information decreased step width by 17% (p = .01), whereas MOSmin was unaffected (p = .12). Regardless of information, subject-specific regressions between step-by-step values of step width and MOSmin explained, on average, only 5% of the shared variance (β = 0.11 ± 0.05). Thus, MOSmin appears to be insensitive to changing step width. Accordingly, during treadmill walking, step width is chosen to maintain MOSmin. If MOSmin remains insensitive to step width across other dynamic tasks, then assessing an individual's stability while performing theses tasks could help describe the health of the motor system. © 2012 Human Kinetics, Inc.

The result shows that the numerical simulation based on CSM is well consistent with the experimental data, which indicates that the modeling based on CSM can be used in the calculation and analysis of charge storage ability of capacitor and electrostatic generator based on functional electrets. Moreover, as simulation based on CSM has higher precision than FEM, investigation of surface charge storage ability and prediction of electrostatic hazards of insulating dielectrics could be realized by using CSM. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Sun, et al.",2021,Improving the Classification Rate of Insulation Defects in Power Cables by Automatic Features Extraction and Sample Augmentation of Partial Discharge Signal,10.1142/S021800142150035X,"Conventional pattern recognition methods employed for differentiating the types of insulation defects in power cables usually rely on the manual extraction of partial discharge features, which is inefficient and easily affected by subjective uncertainty. This work addresses this problem by proposing a new framework based on the automatic features extraction of partial discharge signal. The method first applies a sliding time window to convert partial discharge signals in the time domain into two-dimensional images that serve directly as the input to the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Then a nonlinear encoder is employed to automatically extract the features of the partial discharge image data as the input of CNNs for classification. In addition, we address the overfitting problem associated with the few-shot by applying a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to augment the original training dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm; it increases the classification accuracy by 4.18% relative to that achieved with manually extracted features; the overall accuracy of the proposed algorithm training with the augmented dataset is 3.175% higher than that with the original experimental dataset. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Hsu,2011,Continuous EEG signal analysis for asynchronous BCI application,10.1142/S0129065711002870,"In this study, we propose a two-stage recognition system for continuous analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. An independent component analysis (ICA) and correlation coefficient are used to automatically eliminate the electrooculography (EOG) artifacts. Based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, active segment selection then detects the location of active segment in the time-frequency domain. Next, multiresolution fractal feature vectors (MFFVs) are extracted with the proposed modified fractal dimension from wavelet data. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) is adopted for the robust classification of MFFVs. The EEG signals are continuously analyzed in 1-s segments, and every 0.5 second moves forward to simulate asynchronous BCI works in the two-stage recognition architecture. The segment is first recognized as lifted or not in the first stage, and then is classified as left or right finger lifting at stage two if the segment is recognized as lifting in the first stage. Several statistical analyses are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The results indicate that it is a promising system in the applications of asynchronous BCI work. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.       "

Zhang, et al.",2012,Vehicle type and make recognition by combined features and rotation forest ensemble,10.1142/S0218001412500048,"Vehicle type/make recognition based on images captured by surveillance cameras is a challenging task in intelligent transportation system and automatic surveillance. In this paper, we comparatively studied two feature extraction methods for image description, i.e. a new multiresolution analysis tool called Fast Discrete Curvelet Transform and the pyramid histogram of oriented gradients (PHOG). Curvelet Transform has better directional and edge representation abilities than widely used wavelet transform, which is particularly appropriate for the description of images rich with edges. PHOG represents the local shape by a histogram of edge orientations computed for each image sub-region, quantized into a number of bins, thus has the ascendency in its description of more discriminating information. A composite feature description from PHOG and Curvelet can further increase the accuracy of classification by taking their complementary information. We also investigated the applicability of the Rotation Forest (RF) ensemble method for vehicle classification based on the combined features. The RF ensemble contains a set of base multilayer perceptrons which are trained using principal component analysis to rotate the original axes of combined features of vehicle images. The class label is assigned by the ensemble via majority voting. Experimental results using more than 600 images from 21 makes of cars/vans show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The composite feature is better than any single feature in the classification accuracy and the ensemble model produces better performance compared to any of the individual neural network base classifier. With a moderate ensemble size of 20, the Rotation Forest ensembles offers a classification rate close to 96.5%, exhibiting promising potentials for real-life applications. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Sorting images are not very clear due to factors such as the enclosed environment and the weak lighting conditions of the warehouse. First, the dual tree complex wavelet transform is used to preprocess the sorting image for noise reduction and other image preprocessing. Second, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed. On the basis of Alexnet neural network, parameters of convolutional layer, ReLU layer and pooling layer of CNN are redefined to accelerate the learning speed of neural network. Lastly, according to the new image classification task, the last three layers of the neural network, the full connection layer, the softmax layer and the classification output layer are defined to adapt to the new image recognition.

An electrical tree consists of branch-like dielectric breakdown paths. Investigation of a number of characteristic PD parameters shows that the φ-q distribution profile has a good correlation with tree growth. The φ-q distribution expresses the average pulse height as a function of the AC voltage-phase angle. The distribution indicates a common profile for trees growing in both epoxy resin and polyethylene.

In the image representation method, the local-based representation is the best selection for object-based image retrieval. As a kernel-based classification method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) has shown impressive performance on image classification. But SVM cannot work on the local-based representation unless there is an appropriate kernel. To address this problem, some representative kernels are proposed in literatures. However, these kernels cannot work effectively in object-based image retrieval due to ignoring the spatial context and the combination of local features. In this article, we present Adjacent Matrix (AM) and the Local Combined Features (LCF) to incorporate the spatial context and the combination of local features into the kernel. We propose the AM-LCF feature vector to represent image content and the AM-LCF kernel to measure the similarities between AM-LCF feature vectors. According to the detailed analysis, we show that the proposed kernel can overcome the deficiencies of existing kernels. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed kernel through experiments of object-based image retrieval on two public image sets. The experimental results show that the performance of object-based image retrieval can be improved by the proposed kernel.       "

Radio-based activity recognition has the advantage that it does not have the privacy concern compared with camera-based solutions, and subjects do not have to carry a device on them. It has been shown channel state information (CSI) can be used for activity recognition in a device-free setting. With the proliferation of wireless devices, it is important to understand how radio frequency interference (RFI) can impact on pervasive computing applications. In this article, we investigate the impact of RFI on device-free CSI-based location-oriented activity recognition. We present data to show that RFI can have a significant impact on the CSI vectors. In the absence of RFI, different activities give rise to different CSI vectors that can be differentiated visually. However, in the presence of RFI, the CSI vectors become much noisier, and activity recognition also becomes harder. Our extensive experiments show that the performance may degrade significantly with RFI. We then propose a number of countermeasures to mitigate the impact of RFI and improve the performance.

Medical teams analyze multiple symptoms and patient history considering verified genetic influences. The proposed method investigates the voice symptoms of this disease. The voice files are processed, and the feature extraction is conducted. Several machine learning techniques are used to recognize Parkinson's and healthy patients. This study focuses on examining PD diagnosis through voice data features. A new multi-agent feature filter (MAFT) algorithm is proposed to select the best features from the voice dataset. The MAFT algorithm is designed to select a set of features to improve the overall performance of prediction models and prevent over-fitting possibly due to extreme reduction to the features. Moreover, this algorithm aims to reduce the complexity of the prediction, accelerate the training phase, and build a robust training model. Ten different machine learning methods are then integrated with the MAFT algorithm to form a powerful voice-based PD diagnosis model. Recorded test results of the PD prediction model using the actual and filtered features yielded 86.38% and 86.67% accuracies on average, respectively. With the aid of the MAFT feature selection, the test results are improved by 3.2% considering the hybrid model (HM) and 3.1% considering the Naïve Bayesian and random forest. Subsequently, an HM, which comprises a binary convolutional neural network and three feature selection algorithms (namely, genetic algorithm, Adam optimizer, and mini-batch gradient descent), is proposed to improve the classification accuracy of the PD. The results reveal that PD achieves an overall accuracy of 93.7%. The HM is integrated with the MAFT, and the combination realizes an overall accuracy of 96.9%.

The mechanistic explanation is evident through the analysis of the internal cell pressure profile and the corresponding individual electrode potential variation in the aging process. Three different stages, each associated with a predominant mechanism for self-discharge, were identified at room temperature, corresponding to a short (10-100 s), an intermediate (10 min-25 h), and a long (2 days-several months) period of aging. All three stages involved reactions with hydrogen gas, which led to the capacity loss. Most of the capacity loss was temporary and could be recovered from subsequent recharge. The effect from oxygen evolution and recombination only showed in the beginning of the self-discharge process and diminished after about 4 h of aging from the fully charged state. Through the remaining part of the intermediate stage, the residual hydrogen gas continued to reduce the positive electrode capacity via a partial discharge. In the final stage of the long aging period, the capacity loss was probably caused by a minute leakage current. From this study, we derived the charge retention as a function of aging time, which can be used for capacity prediction. Good agreement between the predicted value and the test result was found.       "

Several efforts have been undertaken by researchers to classify PD pulses utilizing artificial intelligence techniques. Recently, the focus has shifted to the identification of multiple sources of PD since it is often encountered in real-time measurements. Studies have indicated that classification of multi-source PD becomes difficult with the degree of overlap and that several techniques such as mixed Weibull functions, neural networks, and wavelet transformation have been attempted with limited success. Since digital PD acquisition systems record data for a substantial period, the database becomes large, posing considerable difficulties during classification.

Error-free diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from healthy control (HC) patients at an early stage of the disease is a major concern, because information about the condition's severity and developmental risks present allows AD sufferer to take precautionary measures before irreversible brain damage occurs.

Consequently, timely detection and judgment of the current working status of the bearing is the key to improving productivity. This paper proposes an integrated fault identification technology for rolling bearings, which contains two parts: the fault predetection and the fault recognition. In the part of fault predetection, the threshold based on amplitude-aware permutation entropy (AAPE) is defined to judge whether the bearing currently has a fault. If there is a fault in the bearing, the fault feature is adequately extracted using the feature extraction method combined with dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform (DTCWPT) and generalized composite multiscale amplitude-aware permutation entropy (GCMAAPE). Firstly, the method decomposes the fault vibration signal into a set of subband components through the DTCWPT with good time-frequency decomposing capability. Secondly, the GCMAAPE values of each subband component are computed to generate the initial candidate feature. Next, a low-dimensional feature sample is established using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) with good nonlinear dimensionality reduction performance to choose sensitive features from the initial high-dimensional features. Afterwards, the featured specimen representing fault information is fed into the deep belief network (DBN) model to judge the fault type. In the end, the superiority of the proposed solution is verified by analyzing the collected experimental data. Detection and classification experiments indicate that the proposed solution can not only accurately detect whether there is a fault but also effectively determine the fault type of the bearing. Besides, this solution can judge the different faults more accurately compared with other ordinary methods. Copyright © 2020 Wuqiang Liu et al.       "

Traditional intent recognition methods usually employ a set of statistical features to classify the transitional patterns. However, the statistical features of the short-term signals via the instantaneous conversion are empirically unstable, which may degrade the classification accuracy. Bearing this in mind, we introduce the one-dimensional dual-tree complex wavelet transform (1D-DTCWT) to address the motion intent recognition via lower limb prosthesis. On the one hand, the local analysis ability of the wavelet transform can amplify the instantaneous variation characteristics of gait information, making the extracted features of instantaneous pattern between two adjacent different steady states more stable. On the other hand, the translation invariance and direction selectivity of 1D-DTCWT can help to explore the continuous features of patterns, which better reflects the inherent continuity of human lower limb movements. In the experiments, we have recruited ten able-bodied subjects and one amputee subject and collected data by performing five steady states and eight transitional states. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the able-bodied subjects has reached 98.91%, 98.92%, and 97.27% for the steady states, transitional states, and total motion states, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy of the amputee has reached 100%, 91.16%, and 90.27% for the steady states, transitional states, and total motion states, respectively. The above evidence finally indicates that the proposed method can better explore the gait instantaneous conversion (better expressed as motion intent) between each two adjacent different steady states compared with the state-of-the-art. © 2021 Min Sheng et al.

Conventional control and protection methods primarily give rise to device protection actions in the presence of severe oscillation. On the whole, online monitoring only identifies the frequency and amplitude, whereas it cannot identify the attenuation factor. Moreover, the determination of the warning threshold is more dependent on human experience, so the reliability and rapidity of the early warning cannot be ensured. This study conducts an in-depth investigation of the wind-thermal power bundling and extreme high-voltage alternating current- (AC-) direct current (DC) hybrid transmission system. The major factors of SSO using this system are unclear, which brings difficulties to effective monitoring. Given the mentioned problems, a method combining Levenberg-Marquardt- (LM-) Backpropagation (BP) machine learning and Sensitivity Analysis (SA) and principal component analysis (PCA) is developed. First, the sensitivity analysis of each factor in the system is conducted to identify the major factors of SSO. Subsequently, the historical sample data are reduced with the principal component analysis to reduce the redundancy, which is adopted to train the regression model to determine the attenuation factor and frequency and then send them to the classifier for classification to complete the task of the assessment model. When a novel data signal is uploaded, the assessment model identifies the attenuation factor and frequency and subsequently determines the presence of SSO. Accordingly, an early warning is conducted.

First, the Circle-Gauss hybrid mapping model is employed in the population initialization stage of the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) to eliminate the uneven population distribution of random mapping. Sparrows tend to fall into local extremums during the search process, while the firefly algorithm has a fast optimization speed and strong local search ability. Thus, a firefly disturbance is added in the sparrow search process, and the fitness value is recalculated to update the sparrow position to enhance the sparrow's local optimization ability and accuracy. Finally, based on the SSA, a dynamic step-size strategy is adopted to make the step size dynamically decrease with the number of iterations and improve the accuracy of convergence.

Wenbo, et al.",2020,Partial discharge feature extraction based on synchrosqueezed windowed Fourier transform and multi-scale dispersion entropy,10.1177/0020294020932346,"The recognition of partial discharge mode is an important indicator of the insulation condition in transformers, based on which maintenance can be arranged. Discharge feature extraction is the key to recognize discharge mode. To solve the problem of poor stability and low recognition rate of partial discharge mode, this paper proposes a feature extraction method based on synchrosqueezed windowed Fourier transform and multi-scale dispersion entropy. First, the four partial discharge signals collected under laboratory conditions are decomposed by synchrosqueezed windowed Fourier transform, then a number of band-limited intrinsic mode type functions are obtained, and the original feature quantities of partial discharge signals are obtained by calculating the multi-scale dispersion entropies of each intrinsic mode type function. Based on that, original feature quantity is optimized by using the maximum relevance and minimum redundancy criteria. Finally, the classification is implemented by the support vector machine. Experimental results show that in the case of noise interference, the proposed synchrosqueezed windowed Fourier transform–multi-scale dispersion entropy method can still accurately describe the feature of different discharge signals and has a higher recognition rate than both the empirical mode decomposition–multi-scale dispersion entropy method and the direct multi-scale dispersion entropy method. © The Author(s) 2020.

"M. Van, et al.",2016,Two-stage feature selection for bearing fault diagnosis based on dual-tree complex wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition,10.1177/0954406215573976,"This paper presents an automatic fault diagnosis of different rolling element bearing faults using a dual-tree complex wavelet transform, empirical mode decomposition, and a novel two-stage feature selection technique. In this method, dual-tree complex wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition were used to preprocess the original vibration signal to obtain more accurate fault characteristic information. Then, features in the time domain were extracted from each of the original signals, the coefficients of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform, and some useful intrinsic mode functions to generate a rich combined feature set. Next, a two-stage feature selection algorithm was proposed to generate the smallest set of features that leads to the superior classification accuracy. In the first stage of the two-stage feature selection, we found the candidate feature set using the distance evaluation technique and a k-nearest neighbor classifier. In the second stage, a genetic algorithm-based k-nearest neighbor classifier was designed to obtain the superior combination of features from the candidate feature set with respect to the classification accuracy and number of feature inputs. Finally, the selected features were used as the input to a k-nearest neighbor classifier to evaluate the system diagnosis performance. The experimental results obtained from real bearing vibration signals demonstrated that the method combining dual-tree complex wavelet transform, empirical mode decomposition, and the two-stage feature selection technique is effective in both feature extraction and feature selection, which also increase classification accuracy. © IMechE 2015.

"U. R. Acharya, et al.",2013,Effect of complex wavelet transform filter on thyroid tumor classification in three-dimensional ultrasound,10.1177/0954411912472422,"Ultrasonography has great potential in differentiating malignant thyroid nodules from the benign ones. However, visual interpretation is limited by interobserver variability, and further, the speckle distribution poses a challenge during the classification process. This article thus presents an automated system for tumor classification in three-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasonography data sets. The system first processes the contrast-enhanced ultrasonography images using complex wavelet transform-based filter to mitigate the effect of speckle noise. The higher order spectra features are then extracted and used as input for training and testing a fuzzy classifier. In the off-line training system, higher order spectra features are extracted from a set of images known as the training images. These higher order spectra features along with the clinically assigned ground truth are used to train the classifier and obtain an estimate of the classifier or training parameters. The ground truth tells the class label of the image (i.e. whether the image belongs to a benign or malignant nodule). During the online testing phase, the estimated classifier parameters are applied on the higher order spectra features that are extracted from the testing images to predict their class labels. The predicted class labels are compared with their corresponding original ground truth to evaluate the performance of the classifier. Without utilizing the complex wavelet transform filter, the fuzzy classifier demonstrated an accuracy of 91.6%, while utilizing the complex wavelet transform filter, the accuracy significantly boosted to 99.1%. © IMechE 2013.

Hence, accurate and automatic aging state recognition of the viscoelastic sandwich structure is very significant to monitor structural health state and guarantee equipment operating reliably. To fulfill this task, by analyzing the sensor-based vibration response signals, a novel aging state recognition approach of the viscoelastic sandwich structure based on permutation entropy of dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform and generalized Chebyshev support vector machine is proposed in this article. To extract effective aging feature information, the measured nonlinear and non-stationary vibration response signals are processed by dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform, and multiple permutation entropy features are extracted from the frequency-band signals to reflect structural aging states. For accurate and automatic aging state classification, generalized Chebyshev kernel is introduced, and multi-class generalized Chebyshev support vector machine is developed to classify structural aging states. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a typical viscoelastic sandwich structure is designed and fabricated, and various structural aging states are created through the hot oxygen–accelerated aging of viscoelastic layers. The testing results show that the proposed method can recognize the different structural aging states accurately and automatically. In addition, the superiority of dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform in processing vibration response signals and the performance of generalized Chebyshev support vector machine in classifying structural aging states are respectively validated by comparing with the commonly used methods. © The Author(s) 2019.

Luminance component is the weighted average of the three color channels in the IHS color space and it is not sensitive to noise. According to the characteristics, luminance component was chosen as the measurement to calculate the focus degree. After separating the luminance component and spectrum component, Fisher classification and fuzzy theory were chosen as the fusion rules to conduct the choice of the coefficients after the dual-tree complex wavelet transform. So fusion color image could keep the natural color information as much as possible. This method could solve the problem of color distortion in the traditional algorithms.

In this article, a comprehensive study of bolt looseness identification under random excitation is presented. To fulfill this task, this research focuses on three prominent difficulties, including nonstationary signal processing, subtle feature extraction, and robust state classification. First, a novel filter bank structure of quasi-analytic dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform is constructed to analyze the measured vibration response signals, for purpose of capturing subtle feature information. Then, multiple features are extracted from subband signals to capture the variations of dynamic characteristics, and sensitive features are selected by Laplacian score to construct the low-dimensional feature set. Subsequently, a novel classifier with better generalization performance, named large margin distribution machine, is optimized with the wavelet kernel function and the whale optimization algorithm, in order to handle the intrinsic uncertainty related to the looseness states of bolted structures. After feeding the low-dimensional feature set, the proposed classifier is trained to identify looseness states of bolted structures. Finally, experiments of a two-bolt lapped beam under random excitation are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and two typical loading conditions (paired-bolt looseness and single-bolt looseness) are considered. Besides, the superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing with other analogical methods.

Che, et al.",2022,Lifetime and Aging Degradation Prognostics for Lithium-ion Battery Packs Based on a Cell to Pack Method,10.1186/s10033-021-00668-y,"Aging diagnosis of batteries is essential to ensure that the energy storage systems operate within a safe region. This paper proposes a novel cell to pack health and lifetime prognostics method based on the combination of transferred deep learning and Gaussian process regression. General health indicators are extracted from the partial discharge process. The sequential degradation model of the health indicator is developed based on a deep learning framework and is migrated for the battery pack degradation prediction. The future degraded capacities of both battery pack and each battery cell are probabilistically predicted to provide a comprehensive lifetime prognostic. Besides, only a few separate battery cells in the source domain and early data of battery packs in the target domain are needed for model construction. Experimental results show that the lifetime prediction errors are less than 25 cycles for the battery pack, even with only 50 cycles for model fine-tuning, which can save about 90% time for the aging experiment. Thus, it largely reduces the time and labor for battery pack investigation. The predicted capacity trends of the battery cells connected in the battery pack accurately reflect the actual degradation of each battery cell, which can reveal the weakest cell for maintenance in advance. © 2022, The Author(s).

"H. Wang, et al.",2015,Accurate prediction of nuclear receptors with conjoint triad feature,10.1186/s12859-015-0828-1,"Background: Nuclear receptors (NRs) form a large family of ligand-inducible transcription factors that regulate gene expressions involved in numerous physiological phenomena, such as embryogenesis, homeostasis, cell growth and death. These nuclear receptors-related pathways are important targets of marketed drugs. Therefore, the design of a reliable computational model for predicting NRs from amino acid sequence has now been a significant biomedical problem. Results: Conjoint triad feature (CTF) mainly considers neighbor relationships in protein sequences by encoding each protein sequence using the triad (continuous three amino acids) frequency distribution extracted from a 7-letter reduced alphabet. In addition, chaos game representation (CGR) can investigate the patterns hidden in protein sequences and visually reveal previously unknown structure. In this paper, three methods, CTF, CGR, amino acid composition (AAC), are applied to formulate the protein samples. By considering different combinations of three methods, we study seven groups of features, and each group is evaluated by the 10-fold cross-validation test. Meanwhile, a new non-redundant dataset containing 474 NR sequences and 500 non-NR sequences is built based on the latest NucleaRDB database. Comparing the results of numerical experiments, the group of combined features with CTF and AAC gets the best result with the accuracy of 96.30% for identifying NRs from non-NRs. Moreover, if it is classified as a NR, it will be further put into the second level, which will classify a NR into one of the eight main subfamilies. At the second level, the group of combined features with CTF and AAC also gets the best accuracy of 94.73%. Subsequently, the proposed predictor is compared with two existing methods, and the comparisons show that the accuracies of two levels significantly increase to 98.79% (NR-2L: 92.56%; iNR-PhysChem: 98.18%; the first level) and 93.71% (NR-2L: 88.68%; iNR-PhysChem: 92.45%; the second level) with the introduction of our CTF-based method. Finally, each component of CTF features is analyzed via the statistical significant test, and a simplified model only with the resulting top-50 significant features achieves accuracy of 95.28%. Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate that our CTF-based method is an effective way for predicting nuclear receptor proteins. Furthermore, the top-50 significant features obtained from the statistical significant test are considered as the ""intrinsic features"" in predicting NRs based on the analysis of relative importance. © 2015 Wang and Hu.

"I. J.

The sensor uses one set of transmitter and receiver coils for a multifrequency operation. For a given survey, the user initially specifies a set of operational frequencies in the current bandwidth of 90 Hz to 48 kHz. The transmitter coil then emanates a current waveform that contains all specified frequencies. The duration of this current waveform, called the base period, is typically 1/30 s (a submultiple of local power-line frequency) resulting in an overall data rate at 30 Hz. Receiver channels digitize the secondary field into a time series over a base period, which is then subjected to discrete sine and cosine transforms or convolutions at each transmitted frequency to produce the raw in-phase and quadrature data. Additional convolutions may be included for passively monitoring environmental noise, including powerline emissions. The entire operation, including the system upload/download and realtime monitoring and communication, is done in Microsoft Windows. The fact that the sensor contains only a single set of coils for the broadband operation provides several unique advantages, some of which include (1) corelatable and coherent drift characteristics among frequencies, (2) spectral integrity among frequencies that may be useful for anomaly classification and, possibly, mineral discrimination, (3) tolerance to sferics, (4) tolerance to powerline noise, and (5) light tow body with minimal cockpit hardware suitable for a small helicopter.

Therefore, it is vital to diagnose the insulation quality to detect early signs of insulation failure. It is well known that there is a correlation between Partial discharge (PD) and the insulation quality. Although many works have been done on PD pattern recognition, it is usually performed in a noise free environment. Also, works on PD pattern recognition in actual cable joint are less likely to be found in literature. Therefore, in this work, classifications of actual cable joint defect types from partial discharge data contaminated by noise were performed. Five crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) cable joints with artificially created defects were prepared based on the defects commonly encountered on site. Three different types of input feature were extracted from the PD pattern under artificially created noisy environment. These include statistical features, fractal features and principal component analysis (PCA) features. These input features were used to train the classifiers to classify each PD defect types. Classifications were performed using three different artificial intelligence classifiers, which include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It was found that the classification accuracy decreases with higher noise level but PCA features used in SVM and ANN showed the strongest tolerance against noise contamination. © 2017 Jee Keen Raymond et al.

Existing methods are too complex for an online monitoring system. Moreover, they do not extract diagnostic features from the estimated variables, making them unusable for diagnostics. Two of our previous studies began to address the problem of ""light""algorithms for online estimation of unmeasured variables. The first study deals with models for unmeasured thermal boundary conditions of a turbine blade. These models allow an enhanced prediction of blade lifetime and are sufficiently simple to be used online. The second study introduces unmeasured variable deviations and proves their applicability. However, the algorithms developed were dependent on a specific engine and a specific variable.

This algorithm is based on simple data-driven models and can be used in online monitoring systems. It is evaluated on real data of two different engines affected by compressor fouling. The results prove that the estimates of unmeasured variables are sufficiently accurate, and the deviations of these variables are good diagnostic features.

Zhu, et al.",2011,Insect recognition based on integrated region matching and dual tree complex wavelet transform,10.1631/jzus.C0910740,"To provide pest technicians with a convenient way to recognize insects, a novel method is proposed to classify insect images by integrated region matching (IRM) and dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). The wing image of the lepidopteran insect is preprocessed to obtain the region of interest (ROI) whose position is then calibrated. The ROI is first segmented with the k-means algorithm into regions according to the color features, properties of all the segmented regions being used as a coarse level feature. The color image is then converted to a grayscale image, where DTCWT features are extracted as a fine level feature. The IRM scheme is undertaken to find K nearest neighbors (KNNs), out of which the nearest neighbor is searched by computing the Canberra distance of DTCWT features. The method was tested with a database including 100 lepidopteran insect species from 18 families and the recognition accuracy was 84.47%. For the forewing subset, a recognition accuracy of 92.38% was achieved. The results showed that the proposed method can effectively solve the problem of automatic species identification of lepidopteran specimens. © 2011 Journal of Zhejiang University Science Editorial Office and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

"A. Swedan, et al.",2012,Acoustic detection of partial discharge using signal processing and pattern recognition techniques,10.1784/insi.2012.54.12.667,"The partial discharge (PD) phenomenon is one of the major factors that can lead to insulation deterioration in power transformers. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the insulation status and the detection of PD activities may assist in correctly evaluating the insulation, with any required actions being taken accordingly. Acoustic detection has been applied for detecting and locating PD activities inside power transformers. Although the acoustic detection is immune to electromagnetic interference, the acoustic signals suffer from high attenuation, which makes the detection of PD activities a difficult task. This paper presents a pattern recognition-based technique for enhancing the acoustic detection of partial discharge signals. Different cases for PD generation were simulated, which included the presence of different types of barriers such as cellulose insulation paper and silicon steel core material. In addition, the effects of the tank size and the distance between the PD source and the acoustic sensor on the detection performance were studied. The features extracted from the acquired signals in all cases were fed to an artificial neural network, which was used for training and classification. The results show that the detection performance of acoustic PD signals could be significantly enhanced using features such as signal entropy.       "
"R. Giro, et al.",2022,Online monitoring of inner deposits in crude oil pipelines,10.2118/209825-PA,"The formation of deposits is a very common issue in oil and gas pipeline transportation systems. Such sediments, mainly wax and paraffine for crude oil, or hydrates and water for gas, progressively reduce the free cross-sectional area of the pipe, leading in some cases to the complete occlusion of the conduit. The overall result is a decrease in the transportation performance, with negative economic, environmental, and safety consequences. To prevent this issue, the amount of inner deposits must be continuously and accurately monitored, such that the corresponding cleaning procedures can be performed when necessary. Currently, the former operation is still dictated by best-practice rules pertaining to preventive or reactive approaches, yet the demand from the industry is for predictive solutions that can be deployed online for real-Time monitoring applications. The paper moves toward this direction by presenting a machine learning methodology that leverages pressure measurements to perform online monitoring of the inner deposits in crude oil trunklines. The key point is that the attenuation of pressure transients within the fluid is dependent on the free cross-sectional area of the pipe. Pressure signals, collected from two or more distinct locations along a pipeline, can therefore be exploited to estimate and track in real time the presence and thickness of the deposits. Several statistical indicators, derived from the attenuation of such pressure transients between adjacent acquisition points, are fed to a data-driven regression algorithm that automatically outputs a numeric indicator representing the amount of inner pipe debris. The procedure is applied to the pressure measurements collected for one and a half years on discrete points at a relative distance of 40 and 60 km along an oil pipeline in Italy (100 km length, 16-in. inner diameter pipes). The availability of historical data prepipe and postpipe cleaning campaigns further enriches the proposed data-driven approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed predictive monitoring strategy is capable of tracking the conditions of the entire conduit and of individual pipeline sections, thus determining which portion of the line is subject to the highest occlusion levels. In addition, our methodology allows for real-Time acquisition and processing of data, thus enabling the opportunity for online monitoring. Prediction accuracy is assessed by evaluating the typical metrics used in the statistical analysis of regression problems. © 2022 Society of Petroleum Engineers. All rights reserved.       "

Sun, et al.",2024,Defect Identification Method of Cable Termination based on Improved Gramian Angular Field and ResNet,10.2174/2352096516666230517095542,"Background: This paper proposes a defect identification method for vehicle-mounted cable terminals in electric multiple units (EMUs) based on the improved Graham angle field and residual network to address the issue of low recognition accuracy caused by the lack of partial discharge (PD) and identification data for Ethylene Propylene Rubber (EPR) cable terminal defects. Methods: The improved Gramian angular field (IGAF) characteristic transformation method was used to transform the PD one-dimensional time-series signal into a two-dimensional one after cable terminals with four common insulation defects were constructed, and a PD detection platform was built. Finally, an anti-aliasing downsampling module and attention mechanism were added to the residual network ResNet101 model. The Center loss and Softmax loss functions were integrated to increase accuracy for training and recognition classification. Topological feature images improved the distinguishability of defect categories. Results: The test results showed that the diagnostic method has an accuracy rate of 97.3% for identi-fying PD at the cable terminal.

The engineered textured surfaces have various quantitative roughness measures that specify the quality of the surface. In industrial product quality monitoring systems, it is increasingly important to devise the automated techniques for evaluation of surface roughness. The proposed method is the novel approach for surface roughness evaluation that implements discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) for analysing surface textures. Further, the method emphasizes selection of effective texture descriptors for classification of surfaces according to their roughness values. The experiments are carried out using surfaces manufactured by the machining processes namely milling, casting, shaping, grinding and blasting. We propose combinations of texture descriptors namely standard deviation, kurtosis, the properties of grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and the Canny edge descriptor to form a robust feature set. The Canberra distance metric is used as similarity measure. The algorithm and the results are presented with both DWT and DT-CWT. The feature set comprising standard deviation, kurtosis and GLCM properties gives the correct classification performances of 94.45%, 92.22%, 97.5%, 95%, 95% and 94.38% for milling, casting, shaping, grinding, grit blasting and shot blasting, respectively, with DT-CWT.

The reason for using separate PD impulses for classification is to develop a universal tool with the ability to recognize an insulation defects by analysing very few events in the insulation in a short range of time. Additionally, we found the optimal sample rates for the data acquisition for these network configurations. The necessity of signal filtering was also tested.

"X. Zhao, et al.",2013,Applying WPD and SVD to classification of EM wave induced by partial discharge in power transformer,10.2478/v10187-013-0001-0,"Partial discharge (PD) current is an impulse signal at nanosecond level, which can generate electromagnetic (EM) wave containing broadband frequency information. The frequency band of EM signal is from MHz up to GHz. Due to different PD patterns, impulse currents with different shapes induce different EM waves containing different frequency information. Therefore, using the features extracted from frequency domain of EM signals, the classification of PD patterns can be effectively got. It is good to use wavelet or wavelet packet decomposition to select features. However, if the decomposition level is too shallow to find enough effective features, it cannot group the EM signals to the right pattern. On the contrary, although it is easier to find features to distinguish the PD pattern if the decomposition level is deep, there will be a lot of redundancy variables and it is hard to select features among so many variables. In this paper, a method is presented, which selected features in the whole decomposition tree instead of selecting among the leaf node of the tree, because more potential features can be found in the whole tree. With the present method, it is possible not only to get enough features, but also to eliminate the redundancy variables effectively. In order to validate the method, large EM signals from four PD patterns in a power transformer are acquired as the training data and testing data for feature selection and classification, and three common classification methods are introduced to classify the PD patterns using the features selected by the method. Most of the classification results are satisfactory indicating that the proposed method is effective. © 2013 FEI STU.       "

EAD thrusters can be nearly silent as they do not contain moving parts. It has been shown that EAD can be used to propel an airplane; however, improvements in thrust density are needed for practical applications. We recently proposed using multistaged ducted (MSD) EAD thrusters to improve performance: these devices enclose several serial EAD stages in a duct that contains an inlet and a nozzle. The duct can theoretically contribute to thrust and be used to control the flow properties. Here, we conduct experiments with single-stage and MSD thrusters with up to 10 stages using corona discharges as the ion source. Our 10-stage thruster can produce a thrust per unit cross-sectional area of up to 26 N m−2. This is an order of magnitude higher than that used to fly the first EAD-propelled airplane and is achieved at a similar thrust-to-power ratio. We also compare the experimental results to the predictions from theoretical models and show that these agree with a coefficient of determination of 0.994, providing a means for quantitative design and optimization. © 2024 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

This paper proposes an improved method based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain image classification and image segmentation approach. Automated classification is encouraged by the need of high accuracy when dealing with a human life. The detection of the brain tumour is a challenging problem, due to high diversity in tumour appearance and ambiguous tumour boundaries. MRI images are chosen for detection of brain tumours, as they are used in soft tissue determinations. First of all, image pre-processing is used to enhance the image quality. Second, dual-tree complex wavelet transform multi-scale decomposition is used to analyse texture of an image. Feature extraction extracts features from an image using gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Then, the Neuro-Fuzzy technique is used to classify the stages of brain tumour as benign, malignant or normal based on texture features. Finally, tumour location is detected using Otsu thresholding.

The assembly makes it possible to study the effects of in-line corona treatment, where the delay between the charging and the application of ink is very short but is adjustable from milliseconds to hours or days. The short delay between these process phases is a prerequisite when studying and interpreting liquid wetting and sorption phenomena on substrates, because polar species and polarization effects formed during corona treatment may be both short- and long-lived and the influence of short-lived effects on immediate liquidsubstrate interactions can be significant. The study focuses on evaluating the effects of direct current corona treatment on inkjet ink absorption mechanisms and printability. The substrates were fine papers surfacetreated with cationic polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, anionic sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and anionic fumed silica-based formulations. Both positive and negative direct current corona treatments were studied and it was found that corona treatment increased the optical density of the ink layer and reduced the mottling of ink tracks, indicating a change in the ink setting process. As expected, contact time was an important variable affecting the ink absorption behavior and the visual quality of the ink track.

GPCRs-related pathways are the targets of a large number of marketed drugs. Therefore, the design of a reliable computational model for predicting GPCRs from amino acid sequence has long been a significant biomedical problem. Chaos game representation (CGR) reveals the fractal patterns hidden in protein sequences, and then fractal dimension (FD) is an important feature of these highly irregular geometries with concise mathematical expression. Here, in order to extract important features from GPCR protein sequences, CGR algorithm, fractal dimension and amino acid composition (AAC) are employed to formulate the numerical features of protein samples. Four groups of features are considered, and each group is evaluated by support vector machine (SVM) and 10-fold cross-validation test. To test the performance of the present method, a new non-redundant dataset was built based on latest GPCRDB database. Comparing the results of numerical experiments, the group of combined features with AAC and FD gets the best result, the accuracy is 99.22% and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) is 0.9845 for identifying GPCRs from non-GPCRs. Moreover, if it is classified as a GPCR, it will be further put into the second level, which will classify a GPCR into one of the five main subfamilies. At this level, the group of combined features with AAC and FD also gets best accuracy 85.73%.

This article introduces a novel interdisciplinary approach towards their study. In this sense, the DeciMaS methodological approach to mining and simulating data in complex information systems is introduced. The DeciMaS framework consists of three principal phases, preliminary domain and system analysis, system design and coding, and simulation and decision making. The framework offers a sequence of steps in order to support a domain expert who is not a specialist in data mining during the knowledge discovery process. With this aim a generalized structure of a decision support system (DSS) has been worked out. The DSS is virtually and logically organized into a three-leveled architecture. The first layer is dedicated to data retrieval, fusion and pre-processing, the second one discovers knowledge from data, and the third layer deals with making decisions and generating output information. Data mining is aimed to solve the following problems: association, classification, function approximation, and clustering. DeciMaS populates the second logical level of the DSS with agents which are aimed to complete these tasks. The agents use a wide range of data mining procedures that include approaches for estimation and prediction: regression analysis, artificial networks (ANNs), self-organizational methods, in particular, Group Method of Data Handling, and hybrid methods. The association task is solved with artificial neural networks. The ANNs are trained with different training algorithms such as backpropagation, resilient propagation and genetic algorithms.

Scratch defects cause field intensity distortion, which leads to partial discharge and insulation failure. This study attempts to establish a simulation model of a 220 kV cable terminal to determine the effect of the length, depth, and position of the scratch on the maximum field strength at the defect. The simulation and experiment demonstrate that the maximum field strength at the defect increases with greater length and decreases as the depth increases. Therefore, a prediction method for the terminal defect field strength based on a multivariate nonlinear regression model was proposed in this study. When the defect is located at 20 mm from the root of the stress cone, the maximum field strength is 14.5 MV/m when the length and depth are 2 mm and 1 mm, respectively. The maximum field strength at the defect was predicted based on the length, depth, and position of the scratch defect to evaluate the severity of the defect.

Whereas Although most studies had focused on differences between epileptic patients and healthy controls, the neural mechanisms behind the differences in clinical representations of CPS and SPS were unclear. In the context of the era of precision, medicine makes precise classification of CPS and SPS, which is crucial. To address the above issues, we aimed to investigate the functional network differences between CPS and SPS by constructing support vector machine (SVM) models. They mainly include magnetoencephalography (MEG) data acquisition and processing, construction of functional connectivity matrix of the brain network, and the use of SVM to identify differences in the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC). The obtained results showed that classification was effective and accuracy could be up to 82.69% (training) and 81.37% (test). The differences in functional connectivity between CPS and SPS were smaller in temporal and insula. The differences between the two groups were concentrated in the parietal, occipital, frontal, and limbic systems.

The process involves the formation of conductive channels inside the dielectric. Acoustic emission (AE) is a method of partial discharge detection and measurement, which belongs to the group of non-destructive methods. If electrical treeing is detected, the measurement, recording, and analysis of signals, which accompany the phenomenon, become difficult due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and possible multiple signal reflections from the boundaries of the object. That is why only selected signal parameters are used for the detection and analysis of the phenomenon. A detailed analysis of various acoustic emission signals is a complex and time-consuming process. It has inspired the search for new methods of identifying the symptoms related to partial discharge in the recorded signal. Bearing in mind that a similar signal is searched, denoting a signal with similar characteristics, the use of artificial neural networks seems pertinent. The paper presents an effort to automate the process of insulation material condition identification based on neural classifiers. An attempt was made to develop a neural classifier that enables the detection of the symptoms in the recorded acoustic emission signals, which are evidence of treeing. The performed studies assessed the efficiency with which different artificial neural networks (ANN) are able to detect treeing-related signals and the appropriate selection of such input parameters as statistical indicators or analysis windows.

The model has the advantages of low computational complexity, fast reasoning speed and excellent classification performance. Firstly, we make four typical defect models of PD and conduct a test in a laboratory to collect the PRPD spectra as the data sample. In order to further improve the feature expression ability and recognition accuracy of the model, the lightweight attention mechanism Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module and the nonlinear function hard-swish (h-swish) are added after constructing the MCNN model to eliminate the potential accuracy loss in PD pattern recognition. The MCNN model is trained and tested with the pre-pro-cessed PRPD spectrum, and a variety of methods are used to visualize the model to verify the effec-tiveness of the model. Finally, the performance of MCNN is compared with many existing PD pattern recognition models based on convolutional neural network (CNN), the results show that the proposed MCNN can further reduce the number of parameters of the model and improve the cal-culation speed to achieve the best performance on the premise of good recognition accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the collected data can be inconsistent, incomplete, and noisy, leading to a decreased confidence in data analysis. The paper proposes a novel “judgmental” approach to evaluating the measurement uncertainty of the machine learning model that implements the dropout additive regression trees algorithm. The considered method uses the procedure for expressing the type B measurement uncertainty and the maximal value of the empirical absolute loss function of the model. It is related to the testing and monitoring of power equipment and determining partial discharge location by the non-iterative, all-acoustic method. The example uses the dataset representing the correlation of the mean distance of partial discharge and acoustic sensors and the temperature coefficient of the sensitivity of the non-iterative algorithm. The dropout additive regression trees algorithm achieved the best performance based on the highest coefficient of determination value. Most of the model’s predictions (>97%) fell into the proposed standard measurement uncertainty interval for both “seen” and “unseen” data. © 2022 by the authors.       "

These issues can now be detected and monitored using modern technology. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of deep learning techniques, specifically 1D-CNN model, LSTM model, and 1D-CNN-LSTM model, in detecting arcing problems in switchgear. The hybrid model 1D-CNN-LSTM was the preferred model for fault detection in switchgear because of its superior performance in both time and frequency domains, allowing for analysis of the generated sound wave during an arcing event. To investigate the effectiveness of the algorithms, experiments were conducted to locate arcing faults in switchgear, and the time and frequency domain analyses of performance were conducted. The 1D-CNN-LSTM model proved to be the most effective model for differentiating between arcing and non-arcing situations in the training, validation, and testing stages. Time domain analysis (TDA) showed high success rates of 99%, 100%, and 98.4% for 1D-CNN; 99%, 100%, and 98.4% for LSTM; and 100%, 100%, and 100% for 1D-CNN-LSTM in distinguishing between arcing and non-arcing cases in the respective training, validation, and testing phases. Furthermore, frequency domain analysis (FDA) also demonstrated high accuracy rates of 100%, 100%, and 95.8% for 1D-CNN; 100%, 100%, and 95.8% for LSTM; and 100%, 100%, and 100% for 1D-CNN-LSTM in the respective training, validation, and testing phases.

The training and testing parameters for the ANN and FL comprise statistical fingerprints from different phase-Amplitude-number (f-q-n) measurements. Two PD fault classes considered are internal discharges in voids and surface discharges. In the void class, there are single voids, serial voids and parallel voids in polyethylene terephthalate (PET), while the surface discharge class comprises four different surface discharge arrangements on pressboard in oil at different voltages and angular positioning of the ground electrode on the respective pressboards. Previously, the ANN and FL have been investigated for PD classification, but there is no work reported in the literature that compares their performance, specifically when applied for real time PD detection problem. As expected, both the ANN and FL can recognize PD defect classes, but the results show that the ANN appears to be more robust as compared to the FL, but these conclusions required to be further investigated with complex PD examples. Finally, both the ANN and FL were assessed as practical PD classification.

However, most of these studies have focused on the identification of multiple PD sources, PD classification, or denoising PD measurements, with few studies on real-time PD occurrence detection. In this paper, we propose a method to detect PD occurrence based on anomaly pattern detection. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, in the data preprocessing step, the pulse sequence data are converted into a feature vector stream by applying a sliding window technique. In the next step, normal data modeling is performed using feature vectors transformed from pulse sequence data collected in a normal state where no PD occurs. Finally, for the monitored pulse sequence, an online process for PD detection is carried out through conversion to a feature vector data stream and an anomaly pattern detection method. Experimental results using simulated PD data demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method. © 2020 by the authors.       "
M. Florkowski,2020,Classification of partial discharge images using deep convolutional neural networks,10.3390/en13205496,"Artificial intelligence-based solutions and applications have great potential in various fields of electrical power engineering. The problem of the electrical reliability of power equipment directly refers to the immunity of high-voltage (HV) insulation systems to operating stresses, overvoltages and other stresses-in particular, those involving strong electric fields. Therefore, tracing material degradation processes in insulation systems requires dedicated diagnostics; one of the most reliable quality indicators of high-voltage insulation systems is partial discharge (PD) measurement. In this paper, an example of the application of a neural network to partial discharge images is presented, which is based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, and used to recognize the stages of the aging of high-voltage electrical insulation based on PD images. Partial discharge images refer to phase-resolved patterns revealing various discharge stages and forms. The test specimens were aged under high electric stress, and the measurement results were saved continuously within a predefined time period. The four distinguishable classes of the electrical insulation degradation process were defined, mimicking the changes that occurred within the electrical insulation in the specimens (i.e., start, middle, end and noise/disturbance), with the goal of properly recognizing these stages in the untrained image samples. The results reflect the exemplary performance of the CNN and its resilience to manipulations of the network architecture and values of the hyperparameters. Convolutional neural networks seem to be a promising component of future autonomous PD expert systems. © 2020 by the author.       "
"A. C. N. Pardauil, et al.",2020,Combined approach using clustering-random forest to evaluate partial discharge patterns in hydro generators,10.3390/en13225992,"The measurement and analysis of partial discharges (PD) are like medical examinations, such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), in which there are preestablished criteria. However, each patient will present his particularities that will not necessarily imply his condemnation. The consolidated method for PD processing has high qualifications in the statistical analysis of insulation status of electric generators. However, although the IEEE 1434 standard has well-established standards, it will not always be simple to classify signals obtained in the measurement of the hydro generator coupler due to variations in the same type of PD incidence that may occur as a result of the uniqueness of each machine subject to staff evaluation. In order to streamline the machine diagnostic process, a tool is suggested in this article that will provide this signal classification feature. These measurements will be established in groups that represent each known form of partial discharge established by the literature. It was combined with supervised and unsupervised techniques to create a hybrid method that identified the patterns and classified the measurement signals, with a high degree of precision. This paper proposes the use of data-mining techniques based on clustering to group the characteristic patterns of PD in hydro generators, defined in standards. Then, random forest decision trees were trained to classify cases from new measurements. A comparative analysis was performed among eight clustering algorithms and random forest for choosing which is the superior combination to make a better classification of the equipment diagnosis. R2 was used for assessing the data trend. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.       "
"S. Mantach, et al.",2021,A convolutional neural network-based model for multi-source and single-source partial discharge pattern classification using only single-source training set,10.3390/en14051355,"Classification of the sources of partial discharges has been a standard procedure to assess the status of insulation in high voltage systems. One of the challenges while classifying these sources is the decision on the distinct properties of each one, often requiring the skills of trained human experts. Machine learning offers a solution to this problem by allowing to train models based on extracted features. The performance of such algorithms heavily depends on the choice of features. This can be overcome by using deep learning where feature extraction is done automatically by the algorithm, and the input to such an algorithm is the raw input data. In this work, an enhanced convolutional neural network is proposed that is capable of classifying single sources as well as multiple sources of partial discharges without introducing multiple sources in the training phase. The training is done by using only single-source phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns, while testing is performed on both single and multi-source PRPD patterns. The proposed model is compared with single-branch CNN architecture. The average percentage improvements of the proposed architecture for single-source PDs and multi-source PDs are 99.6% and 96.7% respectively, compared to 96.2% and 77.3% for that of the traditional single-branch CNN architecture. © 2021 by the authors.

Govindarajan, et al.",2021,Development of hankel singular-hypergraph feature extraction technique for acoustic partial discharge pattern classification,10.3390/en14061564,"Different types of classifiers for acoustic partial discharge (PD) pattern classification have been widely discussed in the literature. The classifier performance mainly depends on the measurement conditions (location and type of the PD, acoustic sensor position and frequency response) as well as extracted features. Recent research posits that features extracted by singular value decomposition (SVD) can exhibit the natural characteristics and energy contained in the signal. Though the technique by itself is not novel, in this paper, SVD is employed for PD classification in a revised way starting from data arrangement in Hankel form, to embedding the hypergraphbased features and finally to extracting the required set of optimal features. The algorithm is tested for various measurement conditions that include the influences of various PD locations and oil temperatures. The robustness of the algorithm is also tested using noisy PD signals. Experimental results show the proposed feature extraction method supremacy. © 2021 by the authors.

"B. Adam, et al.",2021,Classification of superimposed partial discharge patterns,10.3390/en14082144,"Phase resolved partial discharge patterns (PRPD) are routinely used to assess the condition of power transformers. In the past, classification systems have been developed in order to automate the fault identification task. Most of those systems work with the assumption that only one source is active. In reality, however, multiple PD sources can be active at the same time. Hence, PRPD patterns can overlap and cannot be separated easily, e.g., by visual inspection. Multiple PD sources in a single PRPD represent a multi-label classification problem. We present a system based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to resolve this task. The system is generally able to classify multiple overlapping PRPD by while only being trained by single class PD sources. The system achieves a single class accuracy of 99% and a mean multi-label accuracy of 43% for an imbalanced dataset. This method can be used with overlapping PRPD patterns to identify the main PD source and, depending on the data, also classify the second source. The method works with conventional electrical measuring devices. Within a detailed discussion of the presented approach, both its benefits but also its problems regarding different repetition rates of different PD sources are being evaluated. © 2021 by the authors.

The algorithm is applied to phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) diagrams with a single dominant partial discharge (PD) source, preparing them for automatic artificial-intelligence-based classification. It was designed to mitigate several sources of distortions often observed in PRPDs obtained from fully operational hydroelectric generators. The capabilities of the denoising algorithm are the automatic removal of sparse noise and the suppression of non-dominant discharges, including those due to crosstalk. The input features are functions of PD distributions along amplitude and phase, which are calculated in a novel way to mitigate random effects inherent to PD measurements. The impact of the proposed contributions was statistically evaluated and compared to classification performance obtained using formerly published approaches. Higher recognition rates and reduced variances were obtained using the proposed methods, statistically outperforming autonomous classification techniques seen in earlier works. The values of the algorithm’s internal parameters are also validated by comparing the recognition performance obtained with different parameter combinations. All typical PD sources described in hydro-generators PD standards are considered and can be automatically detected. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.       "
M. Florkowski,2021,"Anomaly detection, trend evolution, and feature extraction in partial discharge patterns",10.3390/en14133886,"In the resilient and reliable electrical power system, the condition of high voltage insulation plays a crucial role. In the field of high voltage insulation integrity, the partial discharge (PD) inception and development trends are essential for assessment criteria in diagnostics systems. The observed trend to employ more and more sophisticated algorithms with machine learning features and artificial intelligence (AI) elements is observed everywhere. The classification and identification of features in PD images is perceived as a critical requirement for an effective high voltage insulation diagnosis. In this context, techniques allowing for anomaly detection, trends observation, and feature extraction in partial discharge patterns are important. In this paper, the application of few algorithms belonging to image processing, machine learning and optical flow is presented. The feature extraction refers to image segmentation and detection of coherent forms in the images. The anomaly detection algorithms can trigger early detection of the trend changes or the appearance of a new discharge form, and hence are suitable for PD monitoring applications. Anomaly detection can also handle transients and disturbances that appear in the PD image as an indication of an abnormal state. The future monitoring systems should be equipped with trend evolution algorithms. In this context, two examples of insulation aging and application of PD-based monitoring are shown. The first one refers to deep convolutional neural networks used for classification of deterioration stages in high voltage insulation. The latter one demonstrates application of optical flow approach for motion detection in partial discharge images. The motivation for the research was the strive to machine-controlled pattern analysis, leading towards intelligent PD-based diagnostics. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Sena, et al.",2021,Frequency resolved partial discharges based on spectral pulse counting,10.3390/en14216864,"A partial discharge (PD) classification methodology based counting PD pulses in the spectral domain is proposed and presented in this paper. The spectral counting data are processed using the proposed PD Spectral Pulse Counting Mapping technique (PD-SPCM), which leads to a Frequency-Resolved Partial Discharges (FRPD) map. The proposed map is then used for PD detection and classification. In this work, corona and slot FRPDs are presented in frequency bands up to 500 MHz, obtained from laboratory measurements performed using two hydro-generator stator bars. The electromagnetic signals from the PDs were captured using a patch antenna designed for this purpose and a spectral analyzer. The corona and slot PDs were chosen because one can be mistakenly classified as the other because they may present similar Phase Resolved PD (PRPD) maps and may occupy shared spectral bands. Furthermore, corona and slot PDs can occur concurrently. The obtained results show that the corona and slot PDs can be properly identified using the developed methodology, even when they occur simultaneously. This is possible because, as it is experimentally demonstrated, corona and slot PDs have appreciable levels of spectral pulse counting in particular bands of the frequency spectrum. © 2021 by the authors.

All the seven PD sources typical in rotating machines were considered, and up to three simultaneous sources could be identified. The functionality of identifying samples with no valid PDs was also incorporated using a new technique. The data set was composed of phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns obtained from on-line measurements of hydro-generators. From an input PRPD, noise and interference were removed with an improved version of an image-based denoising algorithm previously proposed by the authors. Then, a novel image-based algorithm that separates partially superposed PD clouds was proposed, by decomposing the input pattern into two sub-PRPDs containing discharges of different natures. From the sub-PRPDs, one extracts features quantifying the PD distribution over amplitudes and the contour of PD clouds. Those features are fed as inputs to several artificial neural networks (ANNs), each of which solves a part of the classification problem and acts as a block of a larger system. Once trained, ANNs work collaboratively to identify an unknown sample. Good results were obtained, with overall accuracies ranging from 88% to 94.8% for all the considered PD sources. : © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.       "

This paper presents a novel approach using clustering for data cleaning and feature extraction of phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) plots derived from live operational data. A total of 452 PRPD 2D plots collected from distribution substations over a six-month period were used to test the proposed technique. The output of the clustering technique is evaluated on different types of machine learning classification techniques and the accuracy is compared using balanced accuracy score.

First of all, a three‐dimensional (3‐D) finite element simulation model of the electrostatic field is established for the grading ring area where corona discharge is relatively serious in a typical EHV AC substation. The distribution law for electric field intensity of saddle‐type and elliptical (circular) grading rings is calculated and analyzed, from which the result shows that pipe diameter is the main factor affecting the maximum electric field intensity (MEI) of grading rings with different structures; with continuous increase in pipe diameter, the MEI of grading rings tends to be saturated gradually. In addition, the COI tests of grading rings are carried out and test results are compared with calculation results obtained based on the Peek formula, which shows that the Peek formula has a large error in predicting the COI of a grading ring. Finally, based on test results of the COI, a formula for predicting the COI of an AC grading ring in a plain area with an altitude of 100 m is proposed by considering the effect of both the pipe diameter and the ring diameter. © 2022 by the authors.

"A. Imburgia, et al.",2022,Time Evolution of Partial Discharges in a Dielectric Subjected to the DC Periodic Voltage,10.3390/en15062052,"Partial discharge (PD) detection can be considered one of the most useful tools for assessing the insulation conditions of the power apparatus in high-voltage systems. Under AC conditions, this analysis is widely employed in online and offline tests, such as type tests or commissioning, and can be carried out by applying the phase-resolved PD (PRPD) method, since the patterns can give information about the defect classification. Under DC voltages, the classic pattern recognition method cannot be performed, and the measurements show complexities related to the nature of the phenomena. For this reason, to date, a standard for PD measurements under DC does not exist. In previous papers, a new method for PD detection under DC stress voltages has been proposed by the authors. It is based on the application of a direct current periodic (DCP) waveform useful in obtaining PRPD patterns. The dependence of partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) and PD repetition rate (PDRR) on the δ shape parameter of the DCP for different materials, as well as the capability to recognize different discharge phenomena, provided valid indications on the behavior of PD in the transition from AC to DC. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the time dependence of PD occurring in a dielectric by applying the DCP waveform. In our previous studies, the investigations were focused on the PD behavior under different values of the DC voltage periodic part. In another work, the DCP waveform with both positive and negative polarity was applied to several dielectric materials. In the proposed work, instead, the DCP waveform is applied for a long time in order to observe its effect on the PD behavior for 72 h. In this way, due to the space charge accumulation phenomenon, the aging effect, also due to the space charge accumulation phenomenon, is evaluated. The methodological approach was to acquire PRPD patterns over time and evaluate their trends in comparison with the sinusoidal case. The experimental results show that, with a DCP waveform having δ = 0.6, the aging effect similar to that provided by pure DC stress is observed, while the acquired PRPD patterns are easily interpretated, as in the AC case. © 2022 by the authors.

For this purpose, four antennas specially adapted to be installed in the transformer tank (UHF disk sensor, UHF drain valve sensor, planar inverted F-type antenna, Hilbert curve fractal antenna) and a reference log-periodic antenna were used in laboratory tests. During the research, the main types of PD, typical for oil-paper insulation, were generated, i.e., PD in oil, PD in oil wedge, PD in gas bubbles, surface discharges, and creeping sparks. For the registered UHF PD pulses, nine features in the frequency domain and four features in the wavelet domain were extracted. Then, the PD classification process was carried out with the use of selected methods of supervised machine learning. The study investigated the influence of the number and type of feature on the obtained classification results gained with the following machine-learning methods: decision tree, support vector machine, Bayes method, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant, and ensemble machine. As a result of the works carried out, it was found that the highest accuracies are gathered for the feature representing peak frequency using a decision tree, reaching values, depending on the type of antenna, from 89.7% to 100%, with an average of 96.8%. In addition, it was found that the MRMR method reduces the number of features from 13 to 1 while maintaining very high effectiveness. The broadband log-periodic antenna ensured the highest average efficiency (100%) in the PD classification. In the case of the tested antennas adapted to work in an energy transformer tank, the highest defect-recognition efficiency is provided by the UHF disk sensor (99.3%), and the lowest (89.7%) is by the UHF drain valve sensor. © 2022 by the authors.

The time series of the backscattered Rayleigh light intensity (BRLI) changes at the PD position were collected as the sample data. The coefficients of the time series’ autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models were extracted as features. Next, a classification model trained by the random forest (RF) algorithm was established. After the model’s validation with the experimental data and a comparative analysis with previously published methods, the PD recognition model was simply optimized based on the RF principle.

High-voltage (HV) insulators are critical for the successful operation of HV overhead transmission lines, and a failure in any insulator due to contamination can lead to flashover voltage, which will cause a power outage. However, the electrical performance of HV insulators is highly environment sensitive. The main cause of these flashovers in the industrial, agricultural, desert, and coastal areas, is the insulator contamination caused by unfavorable climatic conditions such as dew, fog, or rain. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to review the different methods adopted to identify the contamination level on high-voltage insulators. Several methods have been developed to observe and measure the contamination level on HV insulators, such as leakage current, partial disgorgement, and images with the help of different techniques. Various techniques have been discussed alongside their advantages and disadvantages on the basis of the published research work in the last decade. The major high-voltage insulator contamination level classification techniques discussed include machine learning, fuzzy logic, neuro–fuzzy interface, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and other methods. The contamination level data will aid the scheduling of the extensive and costly substation insulator, and live line washing performed using high-pressured water. As a result, considerable benefits in terms of improved power system reliability and maintenance cost savings will be realized. This paper provides an overview of the different signal processing and machine-learning methods adopted to identify the contamination level on high-voltage insulators. Various methods are studied, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. The comprehensive review of the islanding methods will provide power utilities and researchers with a reference and guideline to select the best method to be used for contamination level identification based on their effectiveness and economic feasibility. © 2022 by the authors.

The PRPD diagrams were obtained from the stator windings of a real-world hydro-generator rotating machine. The proposed approach integrates classification probabilities into the Kohonen method, producing self-organizing probability maps (SOPMs). For building SOPMs, a group of PRPD diagrams, each containing a single PD pattern for training the Kohonen networks and single- and multiple-class-featured samples for obtaining final SOPMs, is used to calculate the probabilities of each Kohonen neuron to be associated with the various PD classes considered. At the end of this process, a self-organizing probability map is produced. Probabilities are calculated using distances, obtained in the space of features, between neurons and samples. The so-produced SOPM enables the effective classification of PRPD samples and provides the probability that a given PD sample is associated with a PD class.

Online monitoring and accurate localization of partial discharge can provide information on the aging of power equipment, which is of great value for improving the safe operation and maintenance of the power grid. Internal dual partial discharge in transformer windings is a more complex type of fault. Since it is located inside the windings, the signal is attenuated and distorted, making it difficult for traditional monitoring methods to capture such partial discharge signal The Fabry–Perot optical fiber sensor is an ultrasonic detection method that can be built into the transformer interior. This sensor has high sensitivity and a small size, enabling flexible placement at different locations inside the transformer for precise partial discharge detection. Especially for the narrow space inside the high and low voltage windings, F–P sensors can form an array, utilizing the array’s directivity to locate the fault points. In this study, an ultrasonic detection system based on the F–P optical fiber sensor array was developed. The system utilizes a directional cross-localization algorithm based on the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm to accurately locate dual partial discharge sources. This partial discharge detection system was applied to a 35 kV single-phase transformer, enabling the localization of dual partial discharge sources within the high and low voltage windings. Combined with experimental results, this method exhibits high localization accuracy and is particularly suitable for detecting partial discharge phenomena that occur within or between transformer windings. © 2024 by the authors.

Melo, et al.",2024,Separation and Classification of Partial Discharge Sources in Substations,10.3390/en17153804,"This work proposes a methodology for noise removal, separation, and classification of partial discharges in electrical system assets. Partial discharge analysis is an essential method for fault detection and evaluation of the operational conditions of high-voltage equipment. However, it faces several limitations in field measurements due to interference from radio signals, television transmissions, WiFi, corona signals, and multiple sources of partial discharges. To address these challenges, we propose the development of a clustering model to identify partial discharge sources and a classification model to identify the types of discharges. New features extracted from pulses are introduced to model the clustering and classification of discharge sources. The methodology is tested in the laboratory with controlled partial discharge sources, and field tests are conducted in substations to assess its practical applicability. The results of laboratory tests achieved an accuracy of 85% in classifying discharge sources. Field tests were performed in a substation of the Eletrobras group, allowing the identification of at least three potentially defective current transformers. © 2024 by the authors.       "

Lokajová, et al.",2021,Inactivation of dermatophytes causing onychomycosis using non-thermal plasma as a prerequisite for therapy,10.3390/jof7090715,"Following our previous study of the therapy of onychomycosis by non-thermal plasma (NTP) and nail hygiene and to obtain some prerequisite data of dermatophytes sensitivity, the dynamics of those inactivation by NTP plasma was monitored for various strains of Trichophyton iterdigitale, Trichophyton benhamiae, Trichophyton rubrum, and Microsporum canis. Three strains of each species on agar plates were exposed with plasma produced by a DC corona discharge in the point-to-ring arrangement in various time intervals. Although all strains were sufficiently sensitive to plasma action, significant differences were observed in their sensitivity and inactivation dynamics. These differences did not correlate with the species classification of individual strains, but could be assigned to four arbitrarily created types of strain response to NTP according to their sensitivity. These results indicate that the sensitivity to plasma is not an inherent property of the fungal species, but varies from strain to strain. © 2021 by the authors.

Zhu, et al.",2023,Study on Acoustic Emission Characteristics of Fatigue Damage of A7N01 Aluminum Alloy for High-Speed Trains,10.3390/ma16124362,"Online monitoring of the fatigue damage process of A7N01 aluminum alloy base metal and weld seam was conducted based on acoustic emission (AE) and digital microscopic imaging technology. The AE signals were recorded during the fatigue tests and analyzed using the AE characteristic parameter method. Fatigue fracture was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze the source mechanism of AE. The AE results show that the AE count and rise time can effectively predict the initiation of fatigue microcracks in A7N01 aluminum alloy. The digital image monitoring results of a notch tip verified the prediction of fatigue microcracks using the AE characteristic parameters. In addition, the AE characteristics of the A7N01 aluminum alloy under different fatigue parameters were studied, and the relationships between the AE characteristic values of the base metal and weld seam and the crack propagation rate were calculated using the seven-point recurrence polynomial method. These provide a basis for predicting the remaining fatigue damage in the A7N01 aluminum alloy. The present work indicates that AE technology can be used to monitor the fatigue damage evolution of welded aluminum alloy structures. © 2023 by the authors.       "

Wu, et al.",2023,On the Investigation of Frequency Characteristics of a Novel Inductive Debris Sensor,10.3390/mi14030669,"Lubricants have the ability to reduce frictions, prevent wear, convey metal debris particles and increase the efficiency of heat transfer; therefore, they have been widely used in mechanical systems. To assess the safety and reliability of the machine under operational conditions, the development of inductive debris sensors for the online monitoring of debris particles in lubricants has received more attention from researchers. To achieve a high-precision, high-efficiency sensor for accurate prediction on the degree of wear, the equivalent circuit model of the sensor coil has been established, and its equations discovering the relationship between the induced voltage and excitation frequency have been derived. Furthermore, the influence of excitation frequencies and metal debris on the magnetic flux density has been analyzed throughout the simulations to determine the sensor magnetic field. In order to identify a frequency range suitable for detecting both ferrous and non-ferrous materials with a high level of sensitivity, the analytical analysis and experiments have been conducted to investigate the frequency characteristics of the developed inductive debris sensor prototype and its improved inspection capability. Moreover, the developed inductive debris sensor with the noticeable frequency characteristics has been assessed and its theoretical model has been also validated throughout experimental tests. Results have shown that the detection sensitivity of non-ferrous debris by the developed sensor increases with the excitation frequency in the range of 50 kHz to 250 kHz, while more complex results for the detection of ferrous debris have been observed. The detection sensitivity decreases as the excitation frequency increases from 50 kHz to 300 kHz, and then increases with the excitation frequency from 300 kHz to 370 kHz. This leads to the effective selection of the excitation frequency in the process of inspection. In summary, the investigation into the frequency characteristics of the proposed novel inductive debris sensor has enabled its broad applications and also provided a theoretical basis and valuable insights into the development of inductive debris sensors with improved detection sensitivity. © 2023 by the authors.

Ayubi, et al.",2024,Investigation of Partial Discharge Transformation Characteristics in Polyimide (PI) Insulations under High-Frequency Electric Stress,10.3390/polym16172450,"This research delves into the primary issue of polyimide (PI) insulation failures in high-frequency power transformers (HFPTs) by scrutinizing partial discharge development under high-frequency electrical stress. This study employs an experimental approach coupled with a plasma simulation model for a ball–sphere electrode structure. The simulation model integrates the particle transport equation, Poisson equation, and complex chemical reactions to ascertain microscopic parameters, including plasma distribution, electric field, electron density, electron temperature, surface, and space charge distribution. The effect of the voltage polarity and electrical energy on the PD process is also discussed. The contact point plays a pivotal role in triggering partial discharges and culminating in the breakdown of PI insulation. Asymmetry phenomena were found between positive and negative half-cycles by analyzing the PD data stage by stage. A significant number of PDs increased at every stage and the PD amplitude was higher during the negative cycle at the initial stage, but in later stages, the PD amplitude was found to be higher in the positive half-cycle, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the maximum damage occurred near the contact point junction. The simulation results show that the plasma initially accumulates the electron density near the contact point junction. Under the action of the electric field, plasma starts traveling at the PI surface outward from the contact point. Before the PD activity, all parameters have higher values in the plasma head. The microscopic parameters reveal maximum values near the contact point junction, during PD activities where significant damage takes place. These parameter distributions exhibit a decreasing trend over time as when the PD activity ends. The model’s predictions are consistent with the experimental data. The paper lays the foundation for future research in polymer insulation design under high-frequency electrical stress. © 2024 by the authors.       "
"G. Du, et al.",2024,A Novel Hybrid Model Combining Improved VMD and ELM with Extended Maximum Correntropy Criterion for Prediction of Dissolved Gas in Power Transformer Oil,10.3390/pr12010193,"The prediction of dissolved gas change trends in power transformer oil is very important for the diagnosis of transformer faults and ensuring its safe operation. Considering the time series and nonlinear features of the gas change trend, this paper proposes a novel robust extreme learning machine (ELM) model combining an improved data decomposition method for gas content forecasting. Firstly, the original data with nonlinear and sudden change properties will make the forecasting model unstable, and thus an improved variational modal decomposition (IPVMD) method is developed to decompose the original data to obtain the multiple modal dataset, in which the marine predators algorithm (MPA) optimization method is utilized to optimize the free parameters of the VMD. Second, the ELM as an efficient and easily implemented tool is used as the basic model for dissolved gas forecasting. However, the traditional ELM with mean square error (MSE) criterion is sensitive to the non-Gaussian measurement noise (or outliers). In addition, considering the nonlinear non-Gaussian properties of the dissolved gas, a new learning criterion, called extended maximum correntropy criterion (ExMCC), is defined by using an extended kernel function in the correntropy framework, and the ExMCC as a learning criterion is introduced into the ELM to develop a novel robust regression model (called ExMCC-ELM) to improve the ability of ELM to process mutational data. Third, a gas-in-oil prediction scheme is proposed by using the ExMCC-ELM performed on each modal obtained by the proposed IPVMD. Finally, we conducted several simulation studies on the measured data, and the results show that the proposed method has good predictive performance. © 2024 by the authors.       "
"X. Wang, et al.",2024,Constrained Iterative Adaptive Algorithm for the Detection and Localization of RFI Sources Based on the SMAP L-Band Microwave Radiometer,10.3390/rs16101791,"The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite carries an L-band microwave radiometer. This sensor can be used to observe global soil moisture (SM) and sea surface salinity (SSS) within the protected L-band spectrum (1400–1427 MHz). Owing to the complex effects of radio frequency interference (RFI), the SM and SSS data are missing or have low accuracy. In this paper, a constrained iterative adaptive algorithm for the detection, identification, and localization of RFI sources is designed, named MICA-BEID. The algorithm synthesizes antenna temperatures for the third and fourth Stokes parameters before RFI filtering, creating a new polarization parameter called WSPDA, designed to approximate the level of RFI interference on the L-band microwave radiometer. The algorithm then utilizes the WSPDA intensity and distribution density of RFI detection samples to enhance the identification and classification of RFI sources across various intensity levels. By utilizing statistical methods such as the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF), the algorithm dynamically adjusts adaptive parameters, including the RFI detection threshold and the maximum effective radius of RFI sources. Through the application of multiple iterative clustering methods, the algorithm can adaptively detect and identify RFI sources at various satellite orbits and intensity levels. Through extensive comparative analysis with other localization results and known RFI sources, the MICA-BEID algorithm can achieve optimal localization accuracy of approximately 1.2 km. The localization of RFI sources provides important guidance for identifying and turning off illegal RFI sources. Moreover, the localization and long-time-series characteristic analysis of RFI sources that cannot be turned off is of significant value for simulating the spatial distribution characteristics of localized RFI source intensity in local areas. © 2024 by the authors.

EMI signals can be non-stationary which makes their analysis difficult, particularly for pattern recognition applications. This paper elaborates upon a previously developed software condition-monitoring model for improved EMI events classification based on time-frequency signal decomposition and entropy features. The idea of the proposed method is to map multiple discharge source signals captured by EMI and labelled by experts, including PD, from the time domain to a feature space, which aids in the interpretation of subsequent fault information. Here, instead of using only one permutation entropy measure, a more robust measure, called Dispersion Entropy (DE), is added to the feature vector. Multi-Class Support Vector Machine (MCSVM) methods are utilized for classification of the different discharge sources. Results show an improved classification accuracy compared to previously proposed methods. This yields to a successful development of an expert’s knowledge-based intelligent system.

Robles, et al.",2018,Radio-frequency localization of multiple partial discharges sources with two receivers,10.3390/s18051410,"Spatial localization of emitting sources is especially interesting in different fields of application. The focus of an earthquake, the determination of cracks in solid structures, or the position of bones inside a body are some examples of the use of multilateration techniques applied to acoustic and vibratory signals. Radar, GPS and wireless sensors networks location are based on radiofrequency emissions and the techniques are the same as in the case of acoustic emissions. This paper is focused on the determination of the position of sources of partial discharges in electrical insulation for maintenance based on the condition of the electrical equipment. The use of this phenomenon is a mere example of the capabilities of the proposed method but it is very representative because the emission can be electromagnetic in the VHF and UHF ranges or acoustic. This paper presents a method to locate more than one source in space with only two receivers, one of them in a fixed position and the other describing a circumference around the first one. The signals arriving from the different sources to the antennas are first separated using a classification technique based on their spectral components. Then, the individualized time differences of arrival (TDOA) from the sources collected at different angles describe a function, angle versus TDOA, that has all the geometric information needed to locate the source. The paper will show how to derive these functions for any source analytically with the position of the source as unknown parameters. Then, it will be demonstrated that it is possible to fit the curve with experimental measurements of the TDOA to obtain the parameters of the position of each source. Finally, the technique is extended to the localization of the emitter in three dimensions. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.       "

As the acoustic method is known as one of the noninvasive and nondestructive testing methods, this paper proposes a new approach of the classification method for defect identification in power transformers based on the acoustic measurements. Typical application of acoustic emission (AE) method is the detection of partial discharges (PD); however, during PD measurements other defects may also be identified in the transformer.

Furthermore, all of the signals are divided into two groups (PD/other) and in the second step into eight classes of various defects. Based on these, selected classification models including machine learning algorithms were applied to training and validation.

The technique uses the Cross Wavelet Transform (XWT) to process the PD signals and the external disturbances coming from the magnetic antennas installed in the GIS compartments. The measurements were performed in a high voltage (HV) GIS containing a source of PD and common-mode external disturbances, where the external disturbances were created by an electric dipole radiator placed in the middle of the GIS. The PD were created by connecting a needle to the main conductor in one of the GIS compartments. The cross wavelet transform and its local relative phase were used for feature extraction from the PD and the external noise. The features extracted formed linearly separable clusters of PD and external disturbances. These clusters were automatically classified by a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The SVM presented an error rate of 0.33%, correctly classifying 99.66% of the signals.

"A. A. Mas’ud, et al.",2021,Application of the gaussian mixture model to classify stages of electrical tree growth in epoxy resin,10.3390/s21072562,"In high-voltage (HV) insulation, electrical trees are an important degradation phenomenon strongly linked to partial discharge (PD) activity. Their initiation and development have attracted the attention of the research community and better understanding and characterization of the phenomenon are needed. They are very damaging and develop through the insulation material forming a discharge conduction path. Therefore, it is important to adequately measure and characterize tree growth before it can lead to complete failure of the system. In this paper, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) has been applied to cluster and classify the different growth stages of electrical trees in epoxy resin insulation. First, tree growth experiments were conducted, and PD data captured from the initial to breakdown stage of the tree growth in epoxy resin insulation. Second, the GMM was applied to categorize the different electrical tree stages into clusters. The results show that PD dynamics vary with different stress voltages and tree growth stages. The electrical tree patterns with shorter breakdown times had identical clusters throughout the degradation stages. The breakdown time can be a key factor in determining the degradation levels of PD patterns emanating from trees in epoxy resin. This is important in order to determine the severity of electrical treeing degradation, and, therefore, to perform efficient asset management. The novelty of the work presented in this paper is that for the first time the GMM has been applied for electrical tree growth classification and the optimal values for the hyperparameters, i.e., the number of clusters and the appropriate covariance structure, have been determined for the different electrical tree clusters. © 2021 by the authors.

Englert, et al.",2021,Use of hyperspectral imaging for the quantification of organic contaminants on copper surfaces for electronic applications,10.3390/s21165595,"To correctly assess the cleanliness of technical surfaces in a production process, corre-sponding online monitoring systems must provide sufficient data. A promising method for fast, large‐area, and non‐contact monitoring is hyperspectral imaging (HSI), which was used in this paper for the detection and quantification of organic surface contaminations. Depending on the cleaning parameter constellation, different levels of organic residues remained on the surface. After-wards, the cleanliness was determined by the carbon content in the atom percent on the sample surfaces, characterized by XPS and AES. The HSI data and the XPS measurements were correlated, using machine learning methods, to generate a predictive model for the carbon content of the sur-face. The regression algorithms elastic net, random forest regression, and support vector machine regression were used. Overall, the developed method was able to quantify organic contaminations on technical surfaces. The best regression model found was a random forest model, which achieved an R2 of 0.7 and an RMSE of 7.65 At.‐% C. Due to the easy‐to‐use measurement and the fast evaluation by machine learning, the method seems suitable for an online monitoring system. However, the results also show that further experiments are necessary to improve the quality of the prediction models. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.       "

Xu, et al.",2022,Dir-MUSIC Algorithm for DOA Estimation of Partial Discharge Based on Signal Strength Represented by Antenna Gain Array Manifold,10.3390/s22145406,"Inspection robots are widely used in the field of smart grid monitoring in substations, and partial discharge (PD) is an important sign of the insulation state of equipment. PD direction of arrival (DOA) algorithms using conventional beam forming and time difference of arrival (TDOA) require large-scale antenna arrays and high computational complexity, making them difficult to implement on inspection robots. To address this problem, a novel directional multiple signal classification (Dir-MUSIC) algorithm for PD direction finding based on signal strength is proposed, and a miniaturized directional spiral antenna circular array is designed in this paper. First, the Dir-MUSIC algorithm is derived based on the array manifold characteristics. This method uses strength intensity information rather than the TDOA information, which could reduce the computational difficulty and the requirement of array size. Second, the effects of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and array manifold error on the performance of the algorithm are discussed through simulations in detail. Then, according to the positioning requirements, the antenna array and its arrangement are developed and optimized. Simulation results suggested that the algorithm has reliable direction-finding performance in the form of six elements. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is tested by using the designed spiral circular array in real scenarios.

"A. Martins, et al.",2023,Online Monitoring of Sensor Calibration Status to Support Condition-Based Maintenance,10.3390/s23052402,"Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM), based on sensors, can only be reliable if the data used to extract information are also reliable. Industrial metrology plays a major role in ensuring the quality of the data collected by the sensors. To guarantee that the values collected by the sensors are reliable, it is necessary to have metrological traceability made by successive calibrations from higher standards to the sensors used in the factories. To ensure the reliability of the data, a calibration strategy must be put in place. Usually, sensors are only calibrated on a periodic basis; so, they often go for calibration without it being necessary or collect data inaccurately. In addition, the sensors are checked often, increasing the need for manpower, and sensor errors are frequently overlooked when the redundant sensor has a drift in the same direction. It is necessary to acquire a calibration strategy based on the sensor condition. Through online monitoring of sensor calibration status (OLM), it is possible to perform calibrations only when it is really necessary. To reach this end, this paper aims to provide a strategy to classify the health status of the production equipment and of the reading equipment that uses the same dataset. A measurement signal from four sensors was simulated, for which Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with unsupervised algorithms were used. This paper demonstrates how, through the same dataset, it is possible to obtain distinct information. Because of this, we have a very important feature creation process, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means clustering, and classification based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Through three hidden states of the HMM, which represent the health states of the production equipment, we will first detect, through correlations, the features of its status. After that, an HMM filter is used to eliminate those errors from the original signal. Next, an equal methodology is conducted for each sensor individually and using statistical features in the time domain where we can obtain, through HMM, the failures of each sensor. © 2023 by the authors.

Due to susceptibility to the influence of interfering substances, which lowers measurement accuracy, existing automated online monitoring devices for turbidity, a key indicator of a natural water body, feature a single light source and are thus insufficient for more complicated water-quality measurement. The newly developed modularized water-quality monitoring device boasts dual light sources (VIS/NIR), capable of measuring the intensity of scattering, transmission, and reference light at the same time. Coupled with a water-quality prediction model, it can attain a good estimate for continuing monitoring of tap water (<2 NTU, error < 0.16 NTU, relative error < 19.6%) and environmental water samples (<400 NTU, error < 3.86 NTU, relative error < 2.3%).

However, PD signals are wideband signals and the antenna gain pattern functions are always different at different frequencies; therefore, the accuracy can be improved using a wideband Dir-MUSIC algorithm. In this paper, wideband Dir-MUSIC algorithms are discussed and a novel wideband Dir-MUSIC algorithm using the strength proportion (DirSP) is proposed. This algorithm estimates a focusing PD signal at a certain frequency using the strength proportion among different directions, and then the Dir-MUSIC algorithm can process the focusing PD signal at this frequency. In simulations, when the antenna gain functions among different frequency bins are quite different, the Dir-MUSIC algorithm loses accuracy; meanwhile, DirDP performs very well.

"O. Kabot, et al.",2023,Enhanced Fault Type Detection in Covered Conductors Using a Stacked Ensemble and Novel Algorithm Combination,10.3390/s23208353,"This study introduces an innovative approach to enhance fault detection in XLPE-covered conductors used for power distribution systems. These covered conductors are widely utilized in forested areas (natural parks) to decrease the buffer zone and increase the reliability of the distribution network. Recognizing the imperative need for precise fault detection in this context, this research employs an antenna-based method to detect a particular type of fault. The present research contains the classification of fault type detection, which was previously accomplished using a very expensive and challenging-to-install galvanic contact method, and only to a limited extent, which did not provide information about the fault type. Additionally, differentiating between types of faults in the contact method is much easier because information for each phase is available. The proposed method uses antennas and a classifier to effectively differentiate between fault types, ranging from single-phase to three-phase faults, as well as among different types of faults. This has never been done before. To bolster the accuracy, a stacking ensemble method involving the logistic regression is implemented. This approach not only advances precise fault detection but also encourages the broader adoption of covered conductors. This promises benefits such as a reduced buffer zone, improved distribution network reliability, and positive environmental outcomes through accident prevention and safe covered conductor utilization. Additionally, it is suggested that the fault type detection could lead to a decrease in false positives.       "

For this, PD measurements using the bio-inspired antenna were performed on operational 69 kV potential transformers (PT) in a real substation. After the field experiment, laboratory measurements using the IEC 60270 standard method and a bio-inspired antenna were performed, simultaneously, over the evaluated PT. The results obtained at the substation indicated suspicious frequencies of partial discharge activity in two out of three evaluated potential transformers, mainly for the frequencies of 461 MHz, 1366 MHz, 1550 MHz and 1960 MHz. During the laboratory tests, the presence of partial discharge activity over the suspicious potential transformers was confirmed with the detection of PD apparent charge levels above 20 pC. Finally, the frequency spectrum obtained from the PD signals detected by the bio-inspired antenna in the laboratory presented similar frequency values to those obtained during the practical application at the substation, making it a promising indicator for future defect classification studies using artificial intelligence. © 2023 by the authors.

Partial-discharge signal identification is an important means of assessing the insulation status of electrical equipment and critical to the safe operation of electrical equipment. The identification effect of traditional methods is not ideal because the PD signal collected is subject to strong noise interference. To overcome noise interference, quickly and accurately identify PD signals, and eliminate potential safety hazards, this study proposes a PD signal identification method based on multiscale feature fusion. The method improves identification efficiency through the multiscale feature fusion and feature aggregation of phase-resolved partial-discharge (PRPD) diagrams by using PMSNet. The whole network consists of three parts: a CNN backbone composed of a multiscale feature fusion pyramid, a down-sampling feature enhancement (DSFB) module for each layer of the pyramid to acquire features from different layers, a Transformer encoder module dominated by a spatial interaction–attention mechanism to enhance subspace feature interactions, a final categorized feature recognition method for the PRPD maps and a final classification feature generation module (F-Collect). PMSNet improves recognition accuracy by 10% compared with traditional high-frequency current detection methods and current pulse detection methods. On the PRPD dataset, the validation accuracy of PMSNet is above 80%, the validation loss is about 0.3%, and the training accuracy exceeds 85%.

The proposed method does not rely on training complex deep learning algorithms which demand substantial computational resources and extensive datasets that can pose significant hurdles for the application of on-line partial discharge monitoring. Instead, the developed Cosine Cluster Net (CCNet) model, which is an image processing pipeline, can extract and process patterns from any two-dimensional PRPD plot before employing the cosine similarity function to measure the likeness of the patterns to predefined templates of known defect types. The PRPD pattern recognition capabilities of the model were tested using several manually classified PRPD images available in the existing literature. The model consistently produced similarity scores that identified the same defect type as the one from the manual classification. The successful defect type reporting from the initial trials of the CCNet model together with the speed of the identification, which typically does not exceed four seconds, indicates potential for real-time applications. © 2024 by the authors.

"K. Schiewaldt, et al.",2024,Assessment of UHF Frequency Range for Failure Classification in Power Transformers,10.3390/s24155056,"Ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) sensing is one of the most promising techniques for assessing the quality of power transformer insulation systems due to its capability to identify failures like partial discharges (PDs) by detecting the emitted UHF signals. However, there are still uncertainties regarding the frequency range that should be evaluated in measurements. For example, most publications have stated that UHF emissions range up to 3 GHz. However, a Cigré brochure revealed that the optimal spectrum is between 100 MHz and 1 GHz, and more recently, a study indicated that the optimal frequency range is between 400 MHz and 900 MHz. Since different faults require different maintenance actions, both science and industry have been developing systems that allow for failure-type identification. Hence, it is important to note that bandwidth reduction may impair classification systems, especially those that are frequency-based. This article combines three operational conditions of a power transformer (healthy state, electric arc failure, and partial discharges on bushing) with three different self-organized maps to carry out failure classification: the chromatic technique (CT), principal component analysis (PCA), and the shape analysis clustering technique (SACT). For each case, the frequency content of UHF signals was selected at three frequency bands: the full spectrum, Cigré brochure range, and between 400 MHz and 900 MHz. Therefore, the contributions of this work are to assess how spectrum band limitation may alter failure classification and to evaluate the effectiveness of signal processing methodologies based on the frequency content of UHF signals. Additionally, an advantage of this work is that it does not rely on training as is the case for some machine learning-based methods. The results indicate that the reduced frequency range was not a limiting factor for classifying the state of the operation condition of the power transformer. Therefore, there is the possibility of using lower frequency ranges, such as from 400 MHz to 900 MHz, contributing to the development of less costly data acquisition systems. Additionally, PCA was found to be the most promising technique despite the reduction in frequency band information. © 2024 by the authors.       "

Li, et al.",2013,Calculation model for the propagation of audible noise from high voltage transmission lines,10.3969/j.issn.1003-6520.2013.08.035,"Audible noise from high voltage transmission lines' corona discharge has become one of the decisive factors affecting design of high voltage transmission lines, thus it is very important to study the spatial propagation characteristics of audible noise for its accurate prediction. A calculation model for the propagation of audible noise is presented in this paper, which is based on the basic equation of the sound wave and can involve the influences of the atmosphere absorption and ground effects. The effects of different ground impedances and the atmospheric attenuation on the distribution of sound pressure level are discussed in this paper. The results show that the atmospheric absorption may increase the attenuation of the audible noise, and the ground surface affects both the amplitude and phase of the sound. The spatial distribution fluctuates considering the ground effects. The atmospheric attenuation and the ground effect are closely related to the frequency of the noise. In the frequency range of the audible noise, the influence of atmospheric attenuation on the spatial propagation characteristics is more obvious in high frequency while ground has significant influences in low frequency.

However, the classification of an sEMG becomes difficult when the level of muscle contraction is low and when there are multiple active muscles. The presence of noise and crosstalk from closely located and simultaneously active muscles is exaggerated when muscles are weakly active such as during sustained wrist and finger flexion and of people with neuropathological disorders or who are amputees. This paper reports analysis of fractal length and fractal dimension of two channels to obtain accurate identification of hand and finger flexion. An alternate technique, which consists of source separation of an sEMG to obtain individual muscle activity to identify the finger and hand flexion actions, is also reported. The results show that both the fractal features and muscle activity obtained using modified independent component analysis of an sEMG from the forearm can accurately identify a set of finger and wrist flexion-based actions even when the muscle activity is very weak. © 2010 National Taiwan University.

BLUEs occur globally about 12 times less frequently (Soler et al., 2022) than lightning flashes. The four schemes are based on non-linear functions of the cloud-top height (CTH), the product of the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and total precipitation (TP), the product of CAPE and specific cloud liquid water content (CLWC), and the product of CAPE and specific cloud snow water content (CSWC). Considering that thunderstorms occur on hourly timescales, these parameterizations have been tested using hourly ERA5 data (except for CTH, not available in ERA5) for the meteorological variables considered, finding that the proposed BLUE schemes work fine and are consistent with observations by the Atmosphere–Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM). Moreover, the parameterizations have been implemented in a global chemistry–climate model that generates annual and seasonal global distributions for present-day and end of 21st century climate scenarios. Present-day predictions are in reasonable agreement with recent observations by the ASIM. Predictions for the end of the 21st century suggest BLUE occurrence rates that range between 13 % higher (∼ 3 % K−1) and 52 % higher (∼ 13 % K−1) than present-day average occurrences of BLUEs. © 2024 Sergio Soler et al.

This work was undertaken based on the hypothesis that the characteristics of the harmonic orders caused by different types of Partial Discharge (PD) can be classified. Experimental work was initially performed and the data obtained from it was validated. This work was then followed by an analysis of the data in order to extract the characteristics of harmonics order and to distinguish information of the harmonics distortion. The findings show that different types of PD produce distinctive harmonics characteristics and distinguishable Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) levels. The outcome of this study show that the hypothesis was precise in stating that different PD types can cause different levels and characteristics of harmonic distortions where in all data obtained were able to be classified. The classification criteria were then tested for accuracy and precision. The results obtained from the classification based on harmonics order characteristics show that 100 % of the PD data tested were identified successfully.

A parallel recognition method for partial discharge patterns of HHVPTLs is proposed by implementing wavelet analysis and improved backpropagation neural network (BPNN) to address the shortcomings of low efficiency, poor accuracy, and inability to parallel analysis of current partial discharge (PD) detection algorithms for HHVPTLs. Firstly, considering the non-smoothness of the partial discharge of the HHVPTLs, the wavelet packet decomposition algorithm is implemented to decompose the PD of the HHVPTL and resolve the relevant signal indicators to form the attribute vectors. Then, BPNN is implemented as a classification model. A beetle optimization (DBO) algorithm based on orthogonal contrastive learning improvement is introduced to optimize the BPNN parameters since BPNN has a slow convergence problem and fails easily into a local optimum. The proposed IDBO-BPNN is employed as the model that recognizes and analyzes the parallel partial discharge patterns of HHVPTLs. Finally, the suggested model is implemented to investigate the local discharge data of an HHVPTL in the Kaggle Featured Prediction Competition and is compared with other algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model can more accurately identify whether PDs occur in an HHVPTL and detect phases where PDs occur, with higher overall accuracy and efficiency. An excellent practical performance is achieved. The proposed model can achieve the recognition accuracy of 95.5%, which is 5.3333% higher than that of the DBO-BPNN and far more than other recognition algorithms. © (2024), Yang et al.       "

The results conclude that machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are robust enough such that reduction of PRPD duration from 15-seconds to 1-second causes less than 5 % drop in the classification accuracy. However, this is only true for noise free condition. When the same PD data is overlapped with random noise, the classification accuracy suffers a significant reduction up to 19%.

Specifically, the probabilistic kernel notion of Gaussian processes (GPs) is applied to the distribution prediction of a component's degradation trend. The proposed method exploits the learning ability of a GP and updates its prediction using a feedback mechanism. The methodology is tested on actual turbine blade degradation data for a variety of topologies (i.e., kernels). The GP estimations are compared to those obtained with a nonprobabilistic, kernelbased machine learning algorithm, the support vector regression (SVR).

In this work, we consider the following faults: the contact of a tree branch with a CC and the fall of a conductor on the ground. The standard protection relays are unable to detect the faults and so the faults pose a risk for individuals in the vicinity of the conductor as well as it compromises the overall safety and reliability of the MV distribution system. In this article, we continue with our previous work aimed at the method enabling detection of the faults and we introduce a method enabling a classification of the fault type. Such a classification is especially important for an operator of an MV distribution system to plan the optimal maintenance or repair the faulty conductors since the fall of a tree branch can be solved later whereas the breakdown of a conductor means an immediate action of the operator. © 2016 ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING.

"M. F. Faisal, et al.",2012,Prediction of incipient faults in underground power cables utilizing S-transform and support vector regression,10.15676/ijeei.2012.4.2.1,Incipient faults usually emerge from partial discharges which eventually cause insulation degradation between two insulated cable cores. Early detection of incipient faults is of particular importance because insulation defects caused by incipient faults may lead to permanent faults in underground distribution networks.

Wang, et al.",2024,Research on Online Condition monitoring for Complex System based on Modified Broad Learning Systems,10.17531/ein/183600,"Complex systems contain numerous interacting components, thus deep learning methods with powerful performance and complex structure are often used to achieve condition monitoring. However, the deep learning methods are always too time-consuming and hardware-demanding to be loaded into complex systems for online training and updates. To achieve accurate and timely monitoring of complex system state, based on broad learning system (BLS), an online condition monitoring method is proposed in this paper. General BLSs are based on a randomly generated hidden-layer, usually perform poorly in high-dimensional data classification tasks. In this work, based on correlation and causality, two modified BLSs are proposed and mixed to establish the online monitoring system. Specifically, logistic regression (LR) and structural causal model (SCM) are considered to form rough predictions of the system state, thus to replace the randomly generated ones with no practical significance.

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel mechanical defect feature extraction and classification method that combines independent intrinsic mode function (IIMF) analysis and an improved multi-kernel mapping fast multi-classification relevance vector machine (MKF -mRVM). Enlightened by the differences in the GIS operating vibration mode, the IIMF series were first obtained based on regenerated phase-shifted sinusoid-assisted empirical mode decomposition (RPSEMD) and modal judgments. Then singular value decomposition and time-frequency conversions were performed to construct combined feature matrices. Finally, multikernel mapping and domain sampling were introduced to improve the calculation speed and recognition accuracy of the mRVM, which was more suitable for on-line monitoring. Results show that the proposed RPSEMD-MKF-mRVM model achieves a faster training speed (14.23 s) and higher accuracy (98.21%) than other algorithms, and it can adapt to variable loads. © 2015 CSEE.

Individuals suffering from this condition have a deficiency of dopamine, a neurotransmitter found in the brain's nerve cells that is critical for coordinating body movement. In this study, a new approach is proposed for the diagnosis of PD. Common Average Reference (CAR), Median Common Average Reference (MCAR), and Weighted Common Average Reference (WCAR) methods were primarily utilized to eliminate noise from the multichannel recorded walking signals in the resulting PhysioNet dataset. Statistical features were obtained from the clean walking signals following the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) transformation application.

The vibration signal of bearings can be decomposed into several wavelet components with DTCWT which can describe the local characteristics of vibration signals accurately. And the PE of each wavelet component, which can describe the complexity of a time series, is calculated to be regarded as the fault features. Then forming the standard clustering centers by the FCM, we defined a standard using the Hamming approach degree to evaluate the classification results in the FCM. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, compared with two other typical signal analysis methods: ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and variational mode decomposition (VMD), through extracting fault features, it required to identify the fault types and severities under variable operating conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach has a better accuracy and performance to diagnose a bearing fault under different fault severities and variable operating conditions.

M.

Main purpose of the paper is to yield relevant and reliable method to distinguish between various acoustic emission (AE) signals emitted by PD and other sources, with particular consideration of real-life results rather than laboratory simulations. Therefore, selected examples of real-life AE signals registered in seven different power transformers, under normal operation conditions, within few years are showed and analyzed. Five scenarios are investigated, which represent five types of AE sources: PD generated by artificial sources, and next four real-life sources (including PD in working transformer, oil flow, oil pumps and core). Several different signal processing methods are applied and compared in order to identify the PD signals. As a result, an energy patterns analysis based on the wavelet decomposition is found as the most reliable tool for identification of PD signals. The presented results may significantly support the process of interpretation of the PD measurement results, and may be used by field engineers as well as other researchers involved in PD analysis using AE method.

PD defects can damage cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cables directly, which is one of the most critical electrical issues in the industry. Poor workmanship during cable jointing, aging, or exposure to the surrounding environment is the most common cause of PD in HV cable systems. As a result, the location of the PD signals that occur cannot be classified without identifying the multiple PD signals present in the cable system. In this study, the artificial neural network (ANN) based feedforward back propagation classification technique is used as a diagnostic tool thru MATLAB software in which the PD signal was approached to determine the accuracy of the location PD signal.

"H. J. Xin, et al.",2025,Investigation on Factors Affecting Cognitive Skills in Detection of Driving Fatigue,10.37934/araset.51.2.270280,"Road safety is a worldwide concern where a high number of fatalities and injuries are caused by traffic accidents. One major issue contributing to these incidents is driving while fatigued, which has been recognized as a contributing factor to accidents in many countries. Being tired while driving is a state that encompasses both physical and mental exhaustion and can greatly impair a person's ability to drive safely. Fatigue negatively affects a driver's cognitive abilities, resulting in decreased performance behind the wheel. The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of driving duration, body mass index (BMI), types of roads and gender factor in causing fatigue while driving. Cognitive skills of drivers while driving was measured through the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal gathered from Emotiv EPOC device to measure brain activity. Relationship between cognitive skills and fatigue signalling is then analysed using regression analysis in Design-Expert software. Results indicated that as mental fatigue increases, there is a noticeable decrease in the relative power of beta rhythm, supporting previous research findings. Results on correlation show that the longer the drivers drove, the wearier they become. Obese people experience more fatigue when driving than those with a normal or overweight BMI. Driving on straight roads resulted in greater fatigue compared to driving on winding ones, with female participants indicating higher levels of tiredness than male participants. These insights are crucial for road safety authorities to tailor their supervision methods based on individual characteristics and to design effective driver fatigue warnings. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

A mother wavelet comparison and wavelet decomposition are presented to detect and locate PD signals by dividing them into three processes: 1) signal test generation, employing RC and RLC impedance circuits whereby the output voltage pulses in the RC impedance circuit are expressed as damped exponential pulses (DEPs) and those of the RLC as damped oscilla-tory pulses (DOPs). White Gaussian noise (AWGN) is then added, which mimics the effect of many random processes in measurement systems. The concept involves applying noise to the original signal and removing it with wavelet transform using various wavelet templates such as Daubechies, Coiflet, Symlet, and biorthogonal to separate the signal components. The experiment results are then compared, and a performance evaluation performed using mean square error (MSE) as in the first two signals. 2) DEPs and DOPs are added with a sine wave to simulate a virtual measurement from a measuring instrument according to the superposition principle using a band-pass filter with the frequency range specified by the two elements to determine the frequency of the resulting PD. 3) The results of the PD signal experiments developed in the laboratory are also evaluated for efficiency by subjective measurement by a PD signal specialist.
